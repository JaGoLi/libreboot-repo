Please do not use GitHub to host libreboot. Libreboot is a free software
project, so this is only a request, and not a restriction on the
software.

What's wrong with GitHub?
--------------------------

-   GitHub itself is proprietary software (for
    [business](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html))
-   GitHub serves non-free JavaScript code to its users
-   Tim (GitHub CEO) really likes to talk about freedom, but makes the
    following claims about the GPLv2/3:

> ...The GPL is not focused on freedom. It's too long. Too many
> restrictions. -- Tom Preston-Werner OSCON2013

or how about:

> Notice that everything we keep closed has specific business value that
> could be compromised by giving it away to our competitors. -- source:
> Tom Preston-Werner's
> [blog](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html)

GitHub simply uses Free Software for its own benefit, releasing source
code under a free license only when suited to it's business goals; they
are quite happy to violate the rights of their users, for profit.

By contrast, the libreboot project adheres strictly to the goals of the
Free Software movement, which seeks to eliminate proprietary software to
the point where all software is free.

The opinions expressed by Tom Preston-Werner of GitHub are incompatible
with those of the libreboot project. Users and developers of *[free
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)* are strongly
advised not to use GitHub, for any of their projects.

Where should I host and share my code?
