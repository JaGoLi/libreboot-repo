[Libreboot left the GNU project on 15 September 2016, in protest of
discriminatory firing of a transgender person at the Free Software
Foundation.](gnu.md)

As part of this, we decided that it would be in the best interest of the
libreboot project to no longer rely on any GNU infrastructure. We were
initially contemplating hosting our own mailing lists, but then we
realized that we could simply use the bug tracker on the
[NotABug](https://notabug.org/vimuser/) page for the libreboot project.
This uses NotABug's modified version of Gogs, which is a free
[GitHub](github.md) replacement, and it also has pull requests. Bug
reports and development discussions plus accepting patches is what we
were using the old mailing lists for, but NotABug's bug tracker and
pull request feature is far more efficient for this purpose.

If you are interested in sending bug reports, see
[../tasks/](tasks.md).

If you wish to submit patches to libreboot, see [../git/](git.md).
