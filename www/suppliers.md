Other suppliers
===============

Sellers on eBay
---------------

On the eBay website, in various countries, you can search for libreboot and
you may find some individual sellers providing Libreboot-preinstalled hardware.

We cannot verify the quality of these suppliers, but they do exist.

Some of them also provide choice of GNU+Linux distribution, or they may provide
services where you can ship your Libreboot-compatible device to them and they
would install Libreboot for you.

This can be useful for some people, but due to the nature of eBay, we cannot
link to them since eBay listings are regularly deleted due to expiration (some
sellers may choose to have longer listings, or renew expired listings).

There may also be other websites similar to eBay (e.g. mercado livre, available
for several South American countries) that might have Libreboot hardware on
them.

**If you are considering purchasing from a supplier on eBay, make sure to read
their feedback comments for other products that they sell, and check their
seller rating. Don't get duped by a bad seller!**

Workshops/hackerspaces
----------------------

You may have a GNU+Linux User Group, free software workshop or hackerspace near
you that can help you with installing Libreboot, for instance.
