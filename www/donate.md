The project is funded by [Minifree Ltd](https://minifree.org/) sales of
libreboot-preinstalled systems (laptops, desktops, servers, etc). [Leah
Rowe](contrib.md) runs both Minifree and the Libreboot project.

There are also some libreboot stickers and systems with libreboot
preinstalled that you can purchase, linked to from the [suppliers
page](suppliers.md), which can further support the libreboot project.
