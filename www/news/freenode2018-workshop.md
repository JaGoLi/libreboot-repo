% 2 November 2018

FreeNode Live is the annual conference held by Freenode in Bristol, UK. This
year I, Leah Rowe, will be there doing a talk about Libreboot at 10AM (UK time)
on November 3rd. In addition, I have decided (hence this announcement) at the
last minute that I'm taking my SPI flashing equipment with me. More details
about this conference are on the Freenode Live website:

If anyone attending this conference wants their system flashed with Libreboot,
bring it to the conference. I'll be volunteering at the FSF booth there all
day on both Saturday and Sunday. Just approach me and say hi, basically.

I will also be representing the FSF as a volunteer on both days.
