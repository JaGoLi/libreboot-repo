% Community feedback on whether to offer libreboot.org domain name to FSF

I, Leah Rowe, have stepped down as leader of the Libreboot project. This means
that I must also transfer ownership of the libreboot.org domain name to
another entity. I have chosen to propose the FSF as that entity.

This is something that could be offered to GNU as part of Libreboot's
filed application to re-join GNU.

Commenting will be taken on
<https://www.reddit.com/r/libreboot/comments/67rd46/proposal_transfer_librebootorg_ownership_to_fsf/>
as to whether this decision should be taken. Full reasoning is documented
there.
