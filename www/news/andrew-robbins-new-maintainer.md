On 25 April, Libreboot adopted new [collective governance policies], creating a
flat-hierarchy leadership of four people. As a result, all patches are
reviewed, and all major decisions are voted on by the maintainers with
community input. These policies formalise our democratic standards.

Today, we welcome Andrew Robbins (IRC nick `and_who` and [NotABug] user
[kragle]) as our first new maintainer under the new policy. Going forward,
Andrew will gain push access to Libreboot in order to review patches, as well
as voting rights and IRC operator status.

Andrew works on critical improvements to the build system, many of which have
already been merged. They are passionate about Libreboot, understanding the
project at a deep level, and he has been an active member of the community.
Thus, with unanimous agreement from the existing maintainers, Andrew has joined
the project officially.

We look forward to Andrew's next contributions as our project continues to
grow.

The new list of maintainers is as follows:

- Alyssa Rosenzweig
- Andrew Robbins
- Leah Rowe
- Paul Kocialkowski
- Swift Geek
