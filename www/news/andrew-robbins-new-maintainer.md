On 25 April, only 40 days ago, Libreboot adopted new collective and democratic
management policies, with a flat-hierarchy leadership of 4 people. All patches
go under code review now, and major project decisions are voted on by core
members, with community input. The policy is [here](../management.md), and
formalizes de-facto standards that were already followed prior to its
publication.

**Today, we gain our first new official project member under this new policy.**

Andrew Robbins, IRC nick **and\_who** and notabug user
**[kragle](https://notabug.org/kragle)** has joined the Libreboot project as a
full-time maintainer.

This means: merge rights on the Git repository (for reviewing and merging
contributions by the public), operator status on #libreboot IRC and voting
rights on all major project decisions.

Andrew has been working on major improvements to the build system, some of
which are already merged and are critical for the next Libreboot release.
Andrew has been influential in several major policy decisions already.

Andrew has a deep understanding of and passion for Libreboot as a whole, and
is a perfect fit for the Libreboot project. Thus, with agreement from other
members of core management, Andrew is now an official Libreboot team member.

We very much look forward to seeing what he will do for the project! Everyone
please welcome Andrew into the Libreboot project!

The new list of people on the core management team is as follows:

- Alyssa Rosenzweig
- Andrew Robbins
- Leah Rowe
- Paul Kocialkowski
- Swift Geek
