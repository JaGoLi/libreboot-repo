% Community feedback on whether to offer libreboot.org domain name to SFC

I, Leah Rowe, have stepped down as leader of the Libreboot project. This means
that I must also transfer ownership of the libreboot.org domain name to
another entity. I have chosen to propose the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC)
as that entity.

Commenting will be taken on
<https://www.reddit.com/r/libreboot/comments/67x3bs/proposal_transfer_librebootorg_domain_name/>
as to whether this decision should be taken. Full reasoning is documented
there.

Software Freedom Conservancy is heavily affiliated with the FSF. Conservancy
provides legal services, e.g. GPL enforcement, for those who violate the GNU
General Public License. They generally offer legal services related to Free
Software. Its founder, Bradley Kuhn, is also a former Executive Director of
the FSF. (Karen Sandler, is SFC's current Executive Director).

In addition to legal services, Conservancy also helps promote Free Software
and provides certain infrastructure for Free Software projects, and does
sometimes assist in development of projects.

This is something that could be offered to GNU as part of Libreboot's
filed application to re-join GNU.

Previously, it was proposed that the domain name be transferred to the FSF, but
this was vetoed by an opposing member of the core leadership, when I proposed
it. SFC was then recommended as an alternative, hence this new proposal.
