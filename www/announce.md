title: Libreboot release announcements
...

For information about current and past libreboot releases, see
[../docs/release.html](../docs/release.html)

If you want to be notified when a new version of libreboot is released,
contact Leah Rowe [using her contact information on the contributors
page](contrib.md), and she will add you to a list (in a script) that
sends emails to people when a new Libreboot release is made, with a copy
of the announcement and list of changes. You can unsubscribe any time by
contacting Leah again and she will remove you from the list.

This replaces the mailing lists, which were previously used for this
purpose but the mailing list has been discontinued by the libreboot
project.

If you find a bug in a libreboot release, or in a beta release (or in
the git reposities), [then please let us know!](tasks.md)
