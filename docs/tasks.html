				<li>
					Someone linked to
					<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=XGI-Coreboot-FB-Port">this news post</a>
					about a PCI-E graphics card for which a free VBIOS replacement exists. This card uses the same
					chipset as the onboard GPU in the ASUS KFSN4-DRE mainboard, which is already supported in libreboot.
					This graphics card will allow certain desktop motherboards to be viable in libreboot.

				</li>
				<li>
					Libreboot has so far been biased towards Intel. This needs to end (the sooner, the better). A nice start:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>ASUS KGPE-D16</b>: this is a very modern board. It has support for both Fam10h and Fam15h AMD CPUs. The board is still
							new, and still in production. See
							these coreboot mailing list posts:<br/>
							<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2015-April/079773.html">post 1</a> and
							<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2015-April/079773.html">post 2</a><br/><br/>
							
							The board is fully functional (blobs not required), and will be an instant addition to libreboot.
							See <a href="https://raptorengineeringinc.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php">https://raptorengineeringinc.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php</a><br/><br/>
							
							<a href="http://raptorengineeringinc.com/content/base/main.htm">Raptor Engineering Inc</a> (USA) has ported
							this board to coreboot, and is using the port internally on their computing cluster, for
							the research that they do. This is the same company that ported 
							the <a href="hcl/kfsn4-dre.html">ASUS KFSN4-DRE</a> which is supported in libreboot.
							The owner (and the
							person who ported the board to coreboot), Timothy Pearson (tpearson on freenode IRC) has reached out to the community,
							in request for funding. This funding will pay for the many months of work (at least 4-5 months, for over 10000 
							lines of code any many patches that will need to be split up) to get the code
							upstreamed into coreboot. This is not as simple as just releasing the code; coreboot has a very strict code
							review process (in place to ensure quality control). The patches will have to be split up, with people's
							concerns and comments addressed over a long period, with patches constantly rebased to keep up with the
							latest coreboot master branch. In order to get this done in a decent enough time frame, Raptor Engineering will need
							to work on a more-or-less full-time basis. The funding amounts that he has asked for, are as follows:
							<ul>
								<li>35K USD - This pays for basic support (Fam10h)</li>
								<li>+15K USD (stretch goal) - This pays for S3 (suspend/resume) and text-mode graphics initialization</li>
								<li>+40K USD (stretch goal) - Fam15h CPU support</li>
							</ul>
							Although Raptor would be working for many months to get this upstreamed (merged in coreboot's master branch
							in the git repository), libreboot would merge it more or less instantly, probably in the same week that the
							code is released for review. Raptor would also of course be rebasing the patches on a regular basis, as part
							of the review process, so even if it takes longer for the patches to be merged in coreboot, libreboot would have
							support for this board.<br/><br/>
							
							This is a <b>very</b> high-end board, making for a powerful server or workstation (desktop) system
							that should easily be more than powerful enough for almost everyone. Timothy has replaced the AGESA
							source in coreboot with native initialization code for AMD. The work that he has done can easily be
							extended to support more hardware, so getting this code out and upstreamed is very important.<br/><br/>
							
							Francis Rowe (lead developer of libreboot) is working with Timothy to get a crowd funding campaign started,
							and trying to get as many people as possible interested in pledging towards the campaign.<br/><br/>
							
							If you are interested in donating towards the campaign (once it begins), register your interest by contacting
							Francis Rowe, using the information on the <a href="../contrib/">maintainers page</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Lenovo G505S (works without CPU microcode updates).
							Videos BIOS is not yet fully replaced (openatom doesn't have a working framebuffer, yet, but
							it can draw a bitmap in user space, using a special utility) - 
							<a href="https://github.com/alterapraxisptyltd/openatom">openatom in github</a>.
							SMU needs replacing (ruik/funfuctor/patrickg/mrnuke might be able to help).
						</li>
						<li>
							F2A85-M and E350M1 (libreboot_*_headless.rom). Test openatom (video BIOS replacement). SMU firmware is a problem. XHCI firmware is a problem.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>TODO: Add ARM candidates here (the above systems are all AMD).</b>
							<ul>
								<li>Look into the <i>rockchip</i> (rk3288. note: mali gpu. one or two blobs might need replacing.
								see <a href="http://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2015/05/26/report-on-chrome-os-upstreaming/">this page</a>
								for example) and <i>IBM 'POWER8' platforms</i> - NOTE: ARM systems use the <i>depthcharge</i> payload
								which afaik is free-sw. For GRUB, see <a href="https://wiki.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Grub2">https://wiki.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Grub2</a></li>

							Non-lenovo GM45 laptops:

								Dell Latitude E6400 - quite a few of these online. This is a good laptop to target in coreboot and libreboot.
								NOTE: EC support. ALSO: DDR2 memory (coreboot raminit for GM45 currently only supports DDR3)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Desktop</b> system: Dell Optiplex 755. There are <b>lots</b> of these available online.
							ICH9. DDR2 RAM (needs work in coreboot). No EC (it's a desktop). It will require
							quite a bit of work in coreboot, but this is a very good candidate.
							The ME can probably be removed and disabled, using ich9gen without any modifications
							(or with few modifications). Where are the datasheets? Schematics?

		<h1>Platform-specific bugs</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					GM45: investigate S3/raminit on all models (CPU stepping/cpuid).
					See <a href="hcl/x200.html#ram_s3_microcode">hcl/x200.html#ram_s3_microcode</a>

				</li>
				<li>
					all thinkpads: When the system is running, plugging in an ethernet cable
					doesn't always work (no network), you have to try several times. Booting with
					an ethernet cable attached is reliable. Debug this and fix it.
				</li>
				<li>
					KFSN4-DRE: investigate the 30 second bootblock delay.
					<a href="hcl/kfsn4-dre.html#issues">More info</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					KFSN4-DRE: jittery text-mode graphics.
					<a href="hcl/kfsn4-dre.html#issues">More info</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Fix these issues on GM45/GS45 targets:
					<ul>
						<li>
							X200: text-mode is broken. only framebuffer graphics work. Git-bisect is needed.
						</li>
						<li>
							X60: on the latest coreboot-libre update lately (during June 2015), keyboard works intermittently.
							Bisect and fix.
						</li>
						<li>
							X200/X60: battery drained even while system is "off" on some systems. investigate.
							Could just be the Ethernet controller waiting for a Wake-on-LAN frame.
							'ethtool -s net0 wol d' disables wake on lan until the next boot. There are a lot of ways to make it permanent: netctl. systemd, udev, cron
						</li>
						<li>
							Sound (internal speaker) broken on T500 (works in lenovobios). external speaker/headphones work.
							- probably a different hda_verb
							- <b>different HDA verbs are now used, test this again</b>
						</li>
						<li>
							Fix remaining incompatible LCD panels in native graphics on T500 and T400. 
							See <a href="hcl/gm45_lcd.html">hcl/gm45_lcd.html</a>.
							- EDID related, or difference in how VGA ROM does init. Investigate.
						</li>
						<li>
							T400/T500/R400 (tested on T400): UART (serial port) doesn't work. Investigate.
							(already tried enabling early h8 dock option. some RE with superiotool is needed).
							- kmalkki has an R400. He says he can be contracted for it. (try to DIY first)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Finish all work listed in <a href="future/index.html">future/index.html</a></b>
				</li>
				<li>
					Fix these issues on i945 targets (X60/T60/macbook21)
					<ul>
						<li>
							i945: fix VRAM size (currently 8MB. should be 64MB). 
							See <a href="future/index.html#i945_vram_size">future/index.html#i945_vram_size</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fix remaining incompatible LCD panels in native graphics on T60. 
							See <a href="future/index.html#lcd_i945_incompatibility">future/index.html#lcd_i945_incompatibility</a>.
							- EDID related, or difference in how VGA ROM does init. Investigate.
						</li>
						<li>
							i945: the intel video driver used to initialize the display without native graphics initialization
							and without the extracted video BIOS. It no longer does, so investigate why it does not, and fix
							the regression (fix has to be done in the kernel, Linux).
							See <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2014-June/078104.html">http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2014-June/078104.html</a> and

						</li>
						<li>
							Add fake_vbt tables on i945 systems (also GM45).
						</li>
						<li>
							Commit 26ca08caf81ad2dcc9c8246a743d82ffb464c767 in coreboot, see the while (1) loop that
							waits for the panel to power up on i945. This is an infinite loop if the panel doesn't power up.
							Fix it. Also, are there panels that don't power up? Test this, and fix it.

		<h1>Build system</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					add <i>resources/checksums/*</i> and update it whenever updating the modules
					(coreboot, flashrom, etc) or updating patches.
					For each download script, make it check the sha512 hashes of all the files, to ensure
					that the files match the checksums.
				</li>
				<li>re-enable building of txtmode images (get memtest86 working again first, and fix gm45 txtmode)</li>
				<li>
					When downloading coreboot/grub/memtest/etc using the download scripts, it currently does
					not check the integrity of these sources at all. Libreboot releases are signed, but
					what can be done to improve it is to check the sha512sums of all files downloaded
					by these scripts (which are in the git repository, but not the release archives,
					because the release archives already include these sources). Do this for all
					non-integrated modules used in libreboot.
				</li>
				<li>Make memtest86+ build using coreboot's own crossgcc toolchain. Currently,
				memtest86+ doesn't even work at all when cross-compiled using the toolchain in x86-64 trisquel7</li>
				<li>
					Make libreboot (all of it!) build reproducibly. This is very important.
					<ul>
						<li>Talk to h01ger in coreboot about the coreboot part (he did reproducible.debian.net/coreboot/coreboot.html</li>
						<li>
							h01ger says ------ fchmmr: please keep the reproducible-builds@lists.alioth.debian.org mailing list posted - i'm aware of http://projects.mtjm.eu/work_packages/16 :-)

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					build/release/util currently fails on Parabola (it only works well in Trisquel).
					- this should be made portable. Build (cross-compile all of the dependencies from upstream,
					and include a <i>ccs/</i> release archive. Then use those for dependencies to cross-compile
					everything (this should make portability easy, and there aren't a lot of dependencies
					for the utilities).

	<div class="section">
		<h1>Improvements to the utilities</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Make ich9gen/ich9deblob portable. They both rely extensively on bitfields, and they assume
					little-endian; for instance, mapping a little endian file directly to a struct, instead
					of serializing/deserializing. Re-factor both utilities and make them fully portable.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make ich9gen/ich9deblob/demefactory show GPL license info via <i>--version</i> argument.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adapt linux-libre deblob scripts for use with coreboot. Libreboot is already deblobbed
					using its own script, but updating it is still a bit too manual. linux-libre's deblob
					scripts do an excellent job and (adapted) will make it much easier to maintain coreboot-libre.

			<ul>
				<li>
					Next release after 20150518, relating to the ASUS KFSN4-DRE:
					<ul>
						<li>Remove the note in docs/release.html that says <i>NOTE: not in libreboot 20150518. Only in git, for now.</i></li>
						<li>Remove the note in docs/hcl/kfsn4-dre.html that says <i> NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518. To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it from source using the libreboot git repository. </i></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Next release after 20150518: note, mention that ACPI brightness methods for X60/T60 work again.
				</li>
				<li>
					Get /proc/ioports for all hw logs. (this was added to Motherboard Porting Guide recently)
					- other instructions were also added there. basically, get whatever extra logs are
					desirable, for all systems.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add info about FTDI 	FT232H usbdebug (BBB could be used for this):
					<a href="http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/10063">http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/10063</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Add information from hw registers on all boards.
					Get them for the following remaining boards: X60, T60, macbook21, R400
				</li>
				<li>
					There are no instructions for how to use the GRUB terminal to find
					a grub.cfg manually, or how to boot an installed GNU/Linux manually, 
					so some users get stuck after the initial installation of libreboot
					not knowing how to boot the GNU/Linux system that they had before installing.
					Fix that. (also, promote the FSF-endorsed distros while you do it)
				</li>
				<li>
					Add guides for GM45 laptops in docs/security/

		<h1>EC firmware</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Embedded_controller">http://www.coreboot.org/Embedded_controller</a>
				Replace this on all libreboot targets. Some laptops use an extra SPI flash chip for the EC, some
				have EC in the main chip, some don't use SPI flash at all but have the firmware inside the EC chip itself.
				If the EC has integrated flash then you need to be able to get to the pins on the chip or be able to program them over LPC or SPI (if they have that feature).
				The lenovo laptops currently supported in libreboot all use H8 EC chips (contains flash inside the chip).
				Read the datasheets on how to externally programme the EC. Chromebooks seem to have free EC
				(<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/master/chip/">https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/master/chip/</a>).
