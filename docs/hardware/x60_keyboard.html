			<p>
				Use this guide to replace the keyboard on your ThinkPad X60. Also works for X60s and X60 Tablet.

				Although slightly different, this guide can also be followed for the ThinkPad X200, X200S and X200 Tablet.
				The screws are in more or less the same place, and it's the same procedure.
