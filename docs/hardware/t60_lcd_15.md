Changing the LCD panel on a 15.1" T60
======================================

This is for the 15.1" T60. If you have another size then the procedure
will differ; for example, on 14.1" you have to remove the hinges and
the procedure is a bit more involved than on 15.1".

Insert panel (this one is an LG-Philips LP150E05-A2K1, and there are
others. See

[../hcl/#supported\_t60\_list](../hcl/#supported_t60_list) for what is
recommended on your LCD panel):
