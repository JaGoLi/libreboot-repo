			<p>Initial flashing instructions for X200.</p>
			<p>
				This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ThinkPad X200
				while they still have the original Lenovo BIOS present. This guide
				can also be followed (adapted) if you brick your X200, to know how
				to recover.
			</p>
			<p>
				The X200S is also briefly covered (image showing soldering joints, wired up
				to a BBB). Note, not all X200S or X200 Tablet configurations are supported yet 
				(see <a href="../hcl/x200.html#x200s">../hcl/x200.html#x200s</a></b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Before following this section, please make sure to setup your libreboot ROM properly first. 
				Although ROM images are provided pre-built in libreboot, there are some modifications that 
				you need to make to the one you chose before flashing. (instructions referenced later in
				this guide)

			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the X200: 4MiB
				(32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). This can be identified by the type
				of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8 (8 pins), 8MiB
				is SOIC-16 (16 pins). The X200S uses a WSON package and has the same
				pinout as SOIC-8 (covered briefly later on in this guide) but
				the chip is on the underside of the board (disassembly required).

Here is a photo of the SOIC-8 flash chip: <a href="images/x200/soic8.jpg" alt="freenode IRC #libreboot 01:42 UK/London timezone February 8th 2015: pehjota: fchmmr: Here are two photos in the camera's configured resolution; resize them as you wish: http://www.pehjota.net/~pj/x200/soic-8/.

(image copyright 2015 Patrick &quot;P. J.&quot; McDermott &lt;pj@pehjota.net&gt;, CC BY-SA 3.0 or later)

Look at the pads in that photo, on the left and right. Those are for SOIC-16. Would it be possible to remove the SOIC-8 and solder a SOIC-16
chip on those pins?
</pre>
			<p>
				<b>On the X200S the flash chip is underneath the board, in a WSON package. 
				The pinout is very much the same as a SOIC-8, except you need to solder (there are no clips available). 
				<a href="images/x200/wson_soldered.jpg">images/x200/wson_soldered.jpg</a> (image copyright (C) 2014 <a href="mailto:sgsit@libreboot.org">Steve Shenton</a> under CC-BY-SA 4.0
				or higher, same license that this document uses) shows it wired (soldered) and
				connected to a BBB.</b>
				<br/>
				In this image, a pin header was soldered onto the WSON. Another solution might be to de-solder the WSON-8 chip and put a SOIC-8 there instead.
				Check the list of SOIC-8 flash chips at <a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#flashchips">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#flashchips</a> but
				do note that these are only 4MiB (32Mb) chips. The only X200 SPI chips with 8MiB capacity are SOIC-16. For 8MiB capacity in this case,
				the X201 SOIC-8 flash chip (Macronix 25L6445E) might work.
				<br/>
				Another possible solution: ground GPIO33 and boot up in non-descriptor mode. This might make software flashing possible, if
				it's possible to circumvent any flashing protections that might exist.

					shows everything connected. In this picture, the X200 is being flashed
					with the BBB.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the battery from your X200, then remove all the screws on
					the bottom (underside) of the machine. Then remove the keyboard and palmrest. 
					The flash chip is below the palm rest. Lift back the tape that goes over it,
					and then connect your 5252/5250 (make sure to get it the right way round). 
					Then connect the 3.3v PSU wire (red one) and make sure that everything else is connected.
				</p>
				<p>
					Flashrom binaries for ARM (tested on a BBB) are distributed in libreboot_util. Alternatively,
					libreboot also distributes flashrom source code which can be built.
				</p>
				<p>
					I did (SSH'd into the BBB):<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512</b><br/>
					In my case, the output was:
				</p>

flashrom v0.9.7-r1854 on Linux 3.8.13-bone47 (armv7l)
flashrom is free software, get the source code at http://www.flashrom.org
Calibrating delay loop... OK.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Multiple flash chip definitions match the detected chip(s): &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot;, &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot;, &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot;
Please specify which chip definition to use with the -c &lt;chipname&gt; option.
</pre>
				<p>
					This is just to test that it's working. In my case, I had to define which chip to use, like so (in your case
					it may be different, depending on what flash chip you have):<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot;</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					At this point, you need to create a copy of the original lenovo firmware that is currently flashed. 
					This is so that you can extract the gbe (gigabit ethernet) and flash descriptor regions for use in libreboot. <b>These
					are not blobs, they only contain non-functional data (configuration details, fully readable) which is fully documented in public datasheets.</b>
					The descriptor will need to be modified
					to disable the ME (also disable AMT) so that you can flash a ROM that excludes it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					How to backup factory.rom (change the -c option as neeed, for your flash chip):<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; -r factory.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; -r factory1.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; -r factory2.rom</b><br/>
					Now compare the 3 images:<br/>
					# <b>sha512sum factory*.rom</b><br/>
					If the hashes match, then just copy one of them (the factory.rom) to a safe place (on a drive connected to another machine, not
					the BBB). You will need it later for part of the deblobbing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information about the descriptor, gbe regions and how the ME was removed can be found in the notes linked at
					<a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html</a>. Libreboot ROM images now include
					the 12KiB descriptor+gbe by default, generated using ich9gen;
					<b>however, do note that the MAC address in the Gbe region is generic. Follow the instructions at 
					<a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen</a> and do what it says to change the MAC address
					inside your X200 ROM image, before flashing it.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Assuming that your libreboot ROM image is properly setup (modified descriptor plus gbe region included in the ROM),
					then you can flash (assuming that the filename is <b>libreboot.rom</b>) for example I had to do:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; -w libreboot.rom</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					You might see errors, but if it says <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end, then it's flashed and should boot.
					Test it! (boot your X200)
				</p>
				<p>
					My output when running the command above:
