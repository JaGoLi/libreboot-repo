	<p>
		This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ThinkPad X200
		while they still have the original Lenovo BIOS present. This guide
		can also be followed (adapted) if you brick your X200, to know how
		to recover.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The X200S is also briefly covered (image showing soldering joints, wired up
		to a BBB). Note, the X200S and X200T are unsupported both in coreboot an libreboot at the time of writing (raminit doesn't work). This info
is just for future reference. <b>Only the X200 is supported.</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Before following this section, please make sure to setup your libreboot ROM properly first. 
		Although ROM images are provided pre-built in libreboot, there are some modifications that 
		you need to make to the one you chose before flashing. (instructions referenced later in
		this guide)

		<p>
			There are two possible flash chip sizes for the X200: 4MiB
			(32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). This can be identified by the type
			of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8 (8 pins), 8MiB
			is SOIC-16 (16 pins). The X200S uses a WSON package and has the same
			pinout as SOIC-8 (covered briefly later on in this guide) but
			the chip is on the underside of the board (disassembly required).
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Shopping list (pictures of this hardware is shown later):
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					External SPI programmer: <b>BeagleBone Black</b> (rev. C)
					is highly recommended. Sometimes referred to as 'BBB'.
				</li>
				<li>
					Clip for connecting to the flash chip: <b>Pomona 5250</b>
					(SOIC-8) or <b>Pomona 5250</b> (SOIC-16) is recommended
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>External 3.3V DC power supply</b>. The one used by this
					author has the label HF100W-SF-3.3 on it, but any decent
					supply will be fine. Some people use the 3.3V from an ATX
					PSU for instance (the kind that you get on a typical
					Intel/AMD desktop computer. 6A supply should be fine,
					the one used by this author is 20A (it won't actually use
					that, it's just what the PSU is capable of).
				</li>
				<li>
					Dupont <b>jumper cables</b> (the kinds of cables that you see 
					used on the pins on a raspberry pi - note: the pi is
					proprietary and not endorsed by libreboot, merely refered
					to in this instance to let you know the type of cables.
					You should get male-male, male-female and female-female
					cables in 10cm and 20cm sizes. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Mini USB A-B cable</b> (the BeagleBone probably already comes
					with one.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>FTDI serial board</b>, for unbricking the BeagleBone if
					necessary.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>5V DC power supply</b> (from wall outlet to the BeagleBone).
					The BeagleBone can have power supplied via USB, but a
					dedicated power supply is recommended. 
				</li>

		<h2>Setting up the 3.3V DC PSU</h2>
			<p>
				With my PSU, first I had wire up the mains power cable. Any clover or kettle lead will do. Cut the end off (not the one
				that goes in the wall, but the kettle/clover connector).
				Strip the protection away by a decent length, then strip the wires inside so that a decent amount of
				copper is shown. Then wire up earth/live/neutral. This will vary according to what country you live in
				and/or the colour codes that your cable uses inside. <b>Make sure to get this right, as a botched job
				could result in extreme damage to you and your surroundings. Here's what mine looks like after wiring up
				the power cable: <a href="images/x200/psu_power.jpg">images/x200/psu_power.jpg</a> - also, make sure
				that the plug (for the wall) has the correct fuse. In my case I had a 240V wall socket, and the device
				says that it accepts 1.5A at that voltage, so I used the smallest fuse available (3A). For 110-120V the device
				says it needs 2.8A.</b> Also, if yours looks like in the image linked above, make sure to wrap electrical tape (lots)
				around it for safety. (otherwise, don't touch the terminals while the PSU is plugged in).
			</p>
			<p>
				Now take a red and black 20cm female-female jumper lead, and cut one of the ends off. Strip away the bare copper by about 1 or
				1.5cm so you get this: <a href="images/x200/stripped_jumper_lead.jpg">images/x200/stripped_jumper_lead.jpg</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Black goes on -V, red goes on +V. In my case, I removed those screws from my PSU like this:
				<a href="images/x200/psu_screws_removed.jpg">images/x200/psu_screws_removed.jpg</a>. Then,
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I twisted the exposed copper on the jumper leads (so that they don't fray), and wrapped each to one of the
				screws each, around it near the head. I then screwed them in:
				<a href="images/x200/psu_jumper_leads.jpg">images/x200/psu_jumper_leads.jpg</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are using a different PSU, then the steps will change from those above. Anyway, once you are satisfied,
				continue reading...
			</p>
		<h2>Setting up the BBB</h2>
			<p>
				Since it's a bare board (no case) and you are also touching inside your X200, you should be earthed/grounded. 
				<a href="images/x200/strap.jpg">images/x200/strap.jpg</a> shows how I earthed myself. This is to prevent you 
				from causing any ESD damage. The surface that you place components on should also be earthed/grounded.
				(for this, I used a shielded ESD bag with a wire, copper exposed, attached from the bag to the exposed metal
				part on a radiator, which was earthed - not professional, but it should work. see <a href="images/x200/mat.jpg">images/x200/mat.jpg</a>).
				Most people ignore this advice and don't ground/earth themselves, at their own risk. You should also store the BBB
				in a shielded anti-static bag when you are finished with it.
				(the principles above apply to any computer components, since they are extremely sensitive te ESD).
			</p>
			<p>
				These instructions may or may not work for you. They are simply the steps that this author took.
			</p>
			<p>
				setting up SPIDEV on the BBB: <a href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBone_Black_Enable_SPIDEV#SPI0">http://elinux.org/BeagleBone_Black_Enable_SPIDEV#SPI0</a>
				- If you only setup SPI0, you don't have to disable the HDMI out. (you only need one).
				That guide is for seting up the device overlay for SPIDEV, last part is to make it persist across reboots.
				Needed to turn the BBB into an SPI flasher.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don't bother modifying uEnv.txt. it won't work;
				use the workaround here instead: <a href="http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Loading_custom_capes">http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Loading_custom_capes</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Follow the instructions at <a href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBone_Black_Enable_SPIDEV#SPI0">http://elinux.org/BeagleBone_Black_Enable_SPIDEV#SPI0</a>
				up to (and excluding) the point where it tells you to modify uEnv.txt
			</p>
			<p>
				You need to update the software on the BBB first. Before being able to use apt-get,
				I had to use the workaround defined <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=msg/beagleboard/LPjCn4LEY2I/alozBGsbTJMJ#!msg/beagleboard/LPjCn4LEY2I/alozBGsbTJMJ">here</a>:<br/>

</pre>
			</p>
				Run <b>apt-get update</b> and <b>apt-get upgrade</b> then reboot the BBB, before continuing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Run those commands:<br/>
				# <b>echo BB-SPI0-01 &gt; /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots</b><br/>
				Then I did:<br/>
				# <b>ls -al /dev/spidev0.*</b><br/>
				<i>ls: cannot access /dev/spidev0.*: No such file or directory</i><br/>
				Then I rebooted and did:<br/>
				# <b>cat /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots</b><br/>
				Output:

			<p>
				Then check if the device exists:<br/>
				# <b>ls -al /dev/spidev0.*</b><br/>
				Output:
			</p>
<pre>
ls: cannot access /dev/spidev0.*: No such file or directory
</pre>
			<p>
				It didn't exist under that name, but I then did:<br/>
				# <b>ls -al /dev/spid*</b><br/>
				Output:
			</p>
<pre>
crw-rw---T 1 root spi 153, 0 Nov 19 21:07 /dev/spidev1.0
</pre>
			<p>
				Now the BBB is ready to be used for flashing. Make this persist
				across reboots:<br/>
				In /etc/default/capemgr add <b>CAPE=BB-SPI0-01</b> at the end
				(or change the existing <b>CAPE=</b> entry to say that, if an
				entry already exists.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now you will download and build <b>flashrom</b> on the BBB.<br/>
				# <b>apt-get install libpci-dev pciutils zlib1g-dev libftdi-dev build-essential subversion</b><br/>
				# <b>svn co svn://flashrom.org/flashrom/trunk flashrom</b><br/>
				# <b>cd flashrom/</b><br/>
				# <b>make</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Now test flashrom:<br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512</b><br/>
				Output:
			</p>
<pre>
Calibrating delay loop... OK.
No EEPROM/flash device found.
Note: flashrom can never write if the flash chip isn't found automatically.
</pre>

			<p>
				This means that it's working (the clip isn't connected to any flash chip,
				so the error is fine).

<b>On the X200S (not fully covered in this guide) the flash chip is underneath the board, in a WSON package. 
The pinout is very much the same as a SOIC-8, except you need to solder (there are no clips available).

				I did:<br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512</b><br/>

flashrom is free software, get the source code at http://www.flashrom.org
Calibrating delay loop... OK.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Multiple flash chip definitions match the detected chip(s): &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot;, &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot;, &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot;
Please specify which chip definition to use with the -c &lt;chipname&gt; option.
</pre>
			<p>
				This is just to test that it's working. In my case, I had to define which chip to use, like so (in your case
				it may be different, depending on what flash chip you have):<br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot;</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point, you need to create a copy of the original lenovo firmware that is currently flashed. 
				This is so that you can extract the gbe (gigabit ethernet) and flash descriptor regions for use in libreboot. <b>These
				are not blobs, they only contain non-functional data (configuration details, fully readable) which is fully documented in public datasheets.</b>
				The descriptor will need to be modified
				to disable the ME (also disable AMT) so that you can flash a ROM that excludes it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				How to backup factory.rom (change the -c option as neeed, for your flash chip):<br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; -r factory.rom</b><br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; -r factory1.rom</b><br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; -r factory2.rom</b><br/>
				Now compare the 3 images:<br/>
				# <b>sha512sum factory*.rom</b><br/>
				If the hashes match, then just copy one of them (the factory.rom) to a safe place (on a drive connected to another machine, not
				the BBB). You will need it later for part of the deblobbing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Information about the descriptor and gbe can be found in the notes linked at
				<a href="../hcl/x200_remove_me.html">../hcl/x200_remove_me.html</a> - also shows how to modify them to disable and remove the ME/AMT blob.
				<span style="font-size:1.5em; background:#ccc;"><b><u><i>MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE GUIDE IN THIS LINK, BEFORE CONTINUING.
				FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A BRICKED MACHINE.</i></u></b></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Assuming that your libreboot ROM image is properly setup (modified descriptor plus gbe region included in the ROM),
				then you can flash (assuming that the filename is <b>libreboot.rom</b>) for example I had to do:<br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -c &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; -w libreboot.rom</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				You might see errors, but if it says <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end, then it's flashed and should boot.
				Test it! (boot your X200)
			</p>
			<p>
				My output when running the command above:
