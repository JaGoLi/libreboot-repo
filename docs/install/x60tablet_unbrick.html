		</ul>

	<h1 id="bucts_brick">Brick type 1: bucts not reset.</h1>
		<p>
			You still have Lenovo BIOS, or you had libreboot running and you flashed another ROM; and you had bucts 1 set and
			the ROM wasn't dd'd.* or if Lenovo BIOS was present and libreboot wasn't flashed.<br/><br/>

			In this case, unbricking is easy: reset BUC.TS to 0 by removing that yellow cmos coin (it's a battery) and putting it back after a minute or two:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0008.JPG" alt="" /><br/><br/>

			*Those dd commands should be applied to all newly compiled X60 ROM's (the ROM's in libreboot binary archives already have this applied!):<br/>
			dd if=coreboot.rom of=top64k.bin bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x10000] count=64k<br/>
			dd if=coreboot.rom bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k | hexdump<br/>
			dd if=top64k.bin of=coreboot.rom bs=1 seek=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k conv=notrunc<br/>
			(doing this makes the ROM suitable for use when flashing a machine that still has Lenovo BIOS running,
			using those instructions: <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation">http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation</a>.
		</p>

	<h1 id="recovery">bad rom (or user error), machine won't boot</h1>
		<p>
			In this scenario, you compiled a ROM that had an incorrect configuration, or there is an actual bug preventing your machine from
			booting. Or, maybe, you set BUC.TS to 0 and shut down after first flash while Lenovo BIOS was running. In any case, your machine is bricked and will not boot at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Unbricking&quot; means flashing a known-good (working) ROM. The problem: you can't boot the machine, making this difficult. In this situation, external hardware (see hardware requirements above) is needed which can flash the SPI chip (where libreboot resides).

		</p>

		<p>
			Remove those screws:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0001.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			Remove the HDD:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0002.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			Push keyboard forward to loosen it:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0003.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			Lift:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0004.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			Remove those:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0005.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0006.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			Also remove that (marked) and unroute the antenna cables:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0007.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			Some X60T's you have to unroute those too:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0010.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			Remove the LCD extend board screws. Also remove those screws (see blue marks) and remove/unroute the cables and remove the metal plate:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0008.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			Remove that screw and then remove the board:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0009.JPG" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point, you should wire up your programmer according to it's documentation. For me, this was (see: "SparkFun cable pin reference"):<br/>
			<a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Common_Bus_Pirate_cable_pinouts">http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Common_Bus_Pirate_cable_pinouts</a>.<br/>
			Correlating with the following information, I was able to wire up my pirate correctly:<br/>
			<a href="http://flashrom.org/Bus_Pirate#Connections">http://flashrom.org/Bus_Pirate#Connections</a><br/>
			And by following that advice:<br/>
			<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation#Howto">http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation#Howto</a>.<br/>
			Note: that last page says to wire up only those 5 pins (see below) like that: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.<br/>
			Note: and then, for power it says (on that coreboot.org page) to connect the power jack to the board and connect the
			AC adapter (without powering on the board).<br/>
			Note: I ignored that advice, and wired up all 8 pins. And it worked.<br/>

			Here is the pinout (correlate it with your programmer's documentation):<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0011.JPG" alt="" /><br/>
			(SPI chip here is on the bottom of the board)
		</p>

		<p>
			Bus pirate:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0019.jpg" alt="" /> 
		</p>

		<p>
			Pomona 5250:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0020.jpg" alt="" /> 
		</p>

		<p>
			Connect pomona:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0022.jpg" alt="" /> 
		</p>

		<p>
			Connect pirate to USB on 2nd computer:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0024.jpg" alt="" /> 
		</p>

		<p>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0025.jpg" alt="" /> 
		</p>

		<p>
			On the 2nd machine, I did: <b>flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0 -w bin/x60t/libreboot_ukqwerty.rom</b>
		</p>

		<pre>
			flashrom v0.9.5.2-r1517 on Linux 3.2.0-61-generic (i686), built with libpci 3.1.8, GCC 4.6.3, little endian
			flashrom is free software, get the source code at http://www.flashrom.org

			Calibrating delay loop... delay loop is unreliable, trying to continue OK.
			Found Macronix flash chip "MX25L1605" (2048 kB, SPI) on buspirate_spi.
			Reading old flash chip contents... done.
			Erasing and writing flash chip... Erase/write done.
			Verifying flash... VERIFIED. 
		</pre>

		<p>
			At the end it says "VERIFIED", which means that the procedure worked. If you see this, it means that you can put your X60T back together. So let's do that now. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Reverse the steps to re-assemble your machine.
