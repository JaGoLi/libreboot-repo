			<p>
                Any distribution should work, so long as it uses kernel mode setting for graphics.
                We recommend using distributions that are entirely free software; most distros
                out there have proprietary software in them, but the ones that we recommend
                do not have proprietary software by default.
			</p>
            <p>
                Note: we are not the Free Software Foundation. The recommendations here
                consist of both FSF-endorsed and non-FSF-endorsed distros. Some of these
                distributions wrongly call the whole system <em>Linux</em>. Despite libreboot's
                <a href="../../gnu/">stance against the GNU project</a>, we still agree
                with the free software philosophy and we still want you to call the
                whole system <em>GNU+Linux</em>, since this is the technically correct
                name for the system.
            </p>
            <h2>FSF-endorsed distros</h2>
            <p>
                Many FSF-endorsed GNU+Linux distributions are considered unfit
                for general use by the libreboot project.
                You can read about their problems here:<br/>

        <h2>Debian</h2>
            <p>
                Most of the developers use it (Leah Rowe always uses testing
                releases of Debian). We recommend Debian stable releases for
                most users. If you want to do development, e.g. libreboot
                development, then you should use the testing release of Debian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Debian by default comes without non-free software in the default
                installation or repos. There is a non-free repo that's not added
                by default. Just avoid adding this, and you should have a fully
                free system.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Visit the Debian website</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend using the <em>MATE</em> desktop.
            </p>
        <h2>Devuan</h2>
            <p>
                Devuan is a fork of Debian that does not use the controversial
                <em>systemd</em> init system.
            </p>

            </p>
        <h2>Qubes</h2>
            <p>
                Security-focussed distribution. It makes heavy use of IOMMU and
                hardware virtualization to separate running
                applications, along with other security features. Provides
                a full hypervisor for running applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also heavily in favour of adoption of both Libreboot and Coreboot.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                Of all available Libreboot systems, Qubes is currently only known
                to be compatible with the ASUS KGPE-D16 and KCMA-D8, due to the
                hardware virtualization requirement (and even on those boards,
                only certain CPUs have fully functional virtualization in
                Libreboot).
                </strong>

        <h2>Dragora</h2>
            <p>
                Fully free distribution, with a focus on simple package management
                and configuration. Experienced users might like this distro. It also
                has native support for multiple languages.
            </p>

            </p>
        <h2>Parabola</h2>
            <p>
                Fully free bleeding edge distribution, based on the <em>Arch</em> distribution.
                Good for saavy users and developers in general (some libreboot developers
                use this).
            </p>
            <p>
                Arch users, refer to the <a href="https://wiki.parabola.nu/Migration_from_the_GNU+Linux_distribution_of_Arch">Parabola migration guide</a>.

            <p>
                We recommend using the <em>MATE</em> desktop.
