			<p>
                Any distribution should work, so long as it uses kernel mode setting for graphics.
                We recommend using distributions that are entirely free software; most distros
                out there have proprietary software in them, but the ones that we recommend
                do not have proprietary software by default.
			</p>
            <p>
                Note: we are not the Free Software Foundation. The recommendations here
                consist of both FSF-endorsed and non-FSF-endorsed distros.

        <h2>Debian</h2>
            <p>
                Most of the developers use it (Leah Rowe always uses testing
                releases of Debian). We recommend Debian stable releases for
                most users. If you want to do development, e.g. libreboot
                development, then you should use the testing release of Debian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Debian by default comes without non-free software in the default
                installation or repos. There is a non-free repo that's not added
                by default. Just avoid adding this, and you should have a fully
                free system.
            </p>

            </p>
        <h2>Devuan</h2>
            <p>
                Devuan is a fork of Debian that does not use the controversial
                <em>systemd</em> init system.
            </p>
            <p>
                See: <a href="https://www.devuan.org/os/init-freedom/">https://www.devuan.org/os/init-freedom/</a>.

            </p>
        <h2>Parabola GNU/Linux</h2>
            <p>
                Fully free bleeding edge distribution, based on the <em>Arch</em> distribution.
                Good for saavy users and developers in general (some libreboot developers
                use this).
            </p>
            <p>
                Arch users, refer to the <a href="https://wiki.parabola.nu/Migration_from_the_GNU/Linux_distribution_of_Arch">Parabola migration guide</a>.
