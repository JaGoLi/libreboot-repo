@anchor{#kcma-d8-external-flashing-instructions}
Initial flashing instructions for KCMA-D8.

@strong{Memory initialization is still problematic, for some modules. We recommend avoiding Kingston modules..}

This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ASUS KCMA-D8 motherboard, while they still have the proprietary ASUS BIOS present. This guide can also be followed (adapted) if you brick you board, to know how to recover.

For more general information about this board, refer to @uref{../hcl/kcma-d8.html,../hcl/kcma-d8.html}.

TODO: show photos here, and other info.

@chapter External programmer
@anchor{#external-programmer}
Refer to @uref{bbb_setup.html,bbb_setup.html} for a guide on how to set up an external SPI programmer.

The flash chip is in a PDIP 8 socket (SPI flash chip) on the motherboard, which you take out and then re-flash with libreboot, using the programmer. @strong{DO NOT} remove the chip with your hands. Use a chip extractor tool.
