Initial flashing instructions for X200.

This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ThinkPad X200 while they still have the original Lenovo BIOS present. This guide can also be followed (adapted) if you brick your X200, to know how to recover.

This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ASUS KGPE-D16 motherboard, while they still have the proprietary ASUS BIOS present. This guide can also be followed (adapted) if you brick you board, to know how to recover.

For more general information about this board, refer to @uref{../hcl/kgpe-d16.html,../hcl/kgpe-d16.html}.

If you don't want to install libreboot yourself, companies exist that sell these boards with libreboot pre-installed, along with a free GNU/Linux distribution.

Check the @uref{../../suppliers,suppliers} page for more information.

Refer to @uref{bbb_setup.html,bbb_setup.html} for a guide on how to set up an external SPI programmer.

The flash chip is in a PDIP 8 socket (SPI flash chip) on the motherboard, which you take out and then re-flash with libreboot, using the programmer. @strong{DO NOT} remove the chip with your hands. Use a chip extractor tool.
