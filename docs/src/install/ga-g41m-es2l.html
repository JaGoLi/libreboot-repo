This guide is for those who want libreboot on their Intel GA-G41M-ES2L motherboard while they still have the original BIOS present.

Refer to @uref{bbb_setup.html,bbb_setup.html} for how to set up the BBB for flashing it externally, if you want to do that.

Internal flashing is possible. Boot with proprietary BIOS and GNU/Linux, and run the latest version of flashrom. This
board has 2 flash chips, one is a backup.

Flash the first chip:
./flashrom -p internal:dualbiosindex=0 -w libreboot.rom

Flash the 2nd chip:
./flashrom -p internal:dualbiosindex=1 -w libreboot.rom

That's all!

Do refer to the @uref{../hcl/ga-g41m-es2l.html,compatibility page} for more information about this board.
