This is just a quick guide for reference, use 'man' to know more.

@node Apply a patch
@chapter Apply a patch
@anchor{#apply-a-patch}
To apply a patch to a single file, do that in it's directory:@* @strong{$ patch < foo.patch}

Assuming that the patch is distributed in unified format identifying the file the patch should be applied to, the above will work. Otherwise:@* @strong{$ patch foo.txt < bar.patch}

You can apply a patch to an entire directory, but note the "p level". What this means is that inside patch files will be the files that you intend to patch, identified by path names that might be different when the files ane located on your own computer instead of on the computer where the patch was created. 'p' level instructs the 'patch' utility to ignore parts of the path name to identify the files correctly. Usually a p level of 1 will work, so you would use:@* @strong{$ patch -p1 < baz.patch}

Change to the top level directory before running this. If a patch level of 1 cannot identify the files to patch, then inspect the patch file for file names. For example:@* @strong{/home/user/do/not/panic/yet.c}

and you are working in a directory that contains panic/yet.c, use:@* @strong{$ patch -p5 < baz.patch}

You usually count one up for each path separator (forward slash) removed from the beginning of the path, until you are left with a path that exists in the current working directory. The count is the p level.

Removing a patch using the -R flag@* @strong{$ patch -p5 -R < baz.patch}

@node Create a patch with diff
@chapter Create a patch with diff
@anchor{#create-a-patch-with-diff}
Diff can create a patch for a single file:@* @strong{$ diff -u original.c new.c > original.patch}

For diff'ing a source tree:@* @strong{$ cp -R original new}

Do whatever you want in new/ and then diff it:@* @strong{$ diff -rupN original/ new/ > original.patch}

@node git diff
@chapter git diff
@anchor{#git-diff}
git is something special.

Note: this won't show new files created.

Just make whatever changes you want to a git clone and then:@* @strong{$ git diff > patch.git}

Note the git revision that you did this with:@* @strong{$ git log}

Alternatively (better yet), commit your changes and then use:@* $ @strong{git format-patch -N}@* Replace N with the number of commits that you want to show.

@ref{#pagetop,Back to top of page.}

@node git apply
@chapter git apply
@anchor{#git-apply}
it really is.

Now to apply that patch in the future, just git clone it again and do with the git revision you found from above:@* @strong{$ git reset --hard REVISIONNUMBER}

Now put patch.git in the git clone directory and do:@* @strong{$ git apply patch.git}

If you use a patch from git format-patch, then use @strong{git am patch.git} instead of @strong{git apply patch.git}. git-am will re-create the commits aswell, instead of just applying the patch.
