@chapter URGENT tasks for next upcoming release
@anchor{#urgent-tasks-for-next-upcoming-release}
@itemize
@item
Make libreboot GNU-compatible (see libreboot.org/gnu)
@item
Fix keyboard init on x60/t60 (right now delay isn't long enough. might be fixed upstream)
@item
GM45 laptops in libreboot.git currently have uneven backlight at lower levels.
This was fixed but patch was removed due to upstream changes, with intent to
re-implement fix on top of upstream later. Do that.
@item
use the timeless branch from coreboot (rebase for different revisions). we don't need timestamps.
this is needed for reproducible builds (reproducible builds are for later release, not next release).
See @uref{https://review.coreboot.org/#/c/13412/,https://review.coreboot.org/#/c/13412/}
and @uref{https://review.coreboot.org/#/q/topic:timeless,https://review.coreboot.org/#/q/topic:timeless}
@item
(probably won't be done before release) have damo22 look into vesa framebuffer graphics on d510mo (right
now only text mode works, including in GNU/Linux)

@chapter Platform-specific bugs
@anchor{#platform-specific-bugs}
@itemize
@item
GM45: investigate S3/raminit on all models (CPU stepping/cpuid). Suspend is
broken in newer versions of coreboot on some libreboot laptops (e.g. GM45).
See @uref{hcl/x200.html#ram_s3_microcode,hcl/x200.html#ram_s3_microcode}
@item
KFSN4-DRE: jittery text-mode graphics. @uref{hcl/kfsn4-dre.html#issues,More info}
@item
Fix these issues on GM45/GS45 targets:
@itemize
@item
GM45: broken text-mode. Bisect of coreboot is needed, but we think that it was
broken on the very first commit that introduced native graphics initialization
and ever since. n1cky on IRC was investigating this.
@item
X60: on the latest coreboot-libre update lately (during June 2015), keyboard works intermittently. Bisect and fix.
@item
Fix remaining incompatible LCD panels in native graphics some GM45 and i945 laptops. See @uref{hcl/gm45_lcd.html,hcl/gm45_lcd.html}. - EDID related, or difference in how VGA ROM does init. Investigate.
We do not believe that this actually has anything to do with EDID. We don't
currently know what the problem is.
@end itemize

@item
@strong{Finish all work listed in @uref{future/index.html,future/index.html}}
@item
Fix these issues on i945 targets (X60/T60/macbook21)
@itemize
@item
i945: fix VRAM size (currently 8MB. should be 64MB). See @uref{future/index.html#i945_vram_size,future/index.html#i945_vram_size}.
@item
Fix remaining incompatible LCD panels in native graphics on T60. See @uref{future/index.html#lcd_i945_incompatibility,future/index.html#lcd_i945_incompatibility}. - EDID related, or difference in how VGA ROM does init. Investigate.

@node Improvements to the utilities
@chapter Improvements to the utilities
@anchor{#improvements-to-the-utilities}
@itemize
@item
Make ich9gen/ich9deblob portable. They both rely extensively on bitfields, and they assume little-endian; for instance, mapping a little endian file directly to a struct, instead of serializing/deserializing. Re-factor both utilities and make them fully portable.
@item
Make ich9gen/ich9deblob/demefactory show GPL license info via @emph{--version} argument.
@item
Adapt linux-libre deblob scripts for use with coreboot. Libreboot is already deblobbed using its own script, but updating it is still a bit too manual. linux-libre's deblob scripts do an excellent job and (adapted) will make it much easier to maintain coreboot-libre.
