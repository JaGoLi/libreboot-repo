It is believed that all or most T400 laptops are compatible. See notes about @uref{../install/t400_external.html#cpu_compatibility,CPU compatibility} for potential incompatibilities.

There are two possible flash chip sizes for the T400: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB is SOIC-16.

@strong{The T400 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it by using a modified descriptor: see @uref{gm45_remove_me.html,gm45_remove_me.html}} (contains notes, plus instructions)

Flashing instructions can be found at @uref{../install/index.html#flashrom,../install/index.html#flashrom}

@subsection Hardware virtualization (vt-x)
@anchor{#hardware-virtualization-vt-x}
The T400, when run without CPU microcode updates in coreboot, currently kernel panics if running QEMU with vt-x enabled on 2 cores for the guest. With a single core enabled for the guest, the guest panics (but the host is fine). Working around this in QEMU might be possible; if not, software virtualization should work fine (it's just slower).

On GM45 hardware (with libreboot), make sure that the @emph{kvm} and @emph{kvm_intel} kernel modules are not loaded, when using QEMU.

The following errata datasheet from Intel might help with investigation: @uref{http://download.intel.com/design/mobile/specupdt/320121.pdf,http://download.intel.com/design/mobile/specupdt/320121.pdf}

The T400 is almost identical to the X200, code-wise. See @uref{x200.html,x200.html}.

The coreboot wiki @uref{http://www.coreboot.org/Motherboard_Porting_Guide,shows} how to collect various logs useful in porting to new boards. Following are outputs from the T400:

Version of flashrom used for the external flashing/reading logs is the one that libreboot git revision c164960 uses.
