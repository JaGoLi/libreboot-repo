@chapter ASUS kcma-d8 desktop/workstation board
@anchor{#asus-kcma-d8-desktopworkstation-board}
This is a desktop board using AMD hardware (Fam10h @strong{and Fam15h} CPUs available). It can also be used for building a high-powered workstation. Powered by libreboot. The coreboot port was done by Timothy Pearson of @uref{https://raptorengineeringinc.com/,Raptor Engineering Inc.} and, working with Timothy (and sponsoring the work) merged into libreboot.

@strong{NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518. To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it from source using the libreboot git repository.}

@strong{Memory initialization is still problematic, for some modules. We recommend avoiding Kingston modules..}

Flashing instructions can be found at @uref{../install/index.html#flashrom,../install/index.html#flashrom} - note that external flashing is required (e.g. BBB), if the proprietary (ASUS) firmware is currently installed. If you already have libreboot, by default it is possible to re-flash using software running in GNU/Linux on the kcma-d8, without using external hardware.

@strong{Use Opteron 4200 series (works without microcode updates, including hw virt).}
4300 series needs microcode updates, so avoid those CPUs. 4100 series is too old, and mostly untested.

@node Board status compatibility
@chapter Board status (compatibility)
@anchor{#board-status-compatibility}

@node Form factor
@chapter Form factor
@anchor{#form-factor}
These boards use the SSI EEB 3.61 form factor; make sure that your case supports this. This form factor is similar to E-ATX in that the size is identical, but the position of the screws are different.

@node IPMI iKVM module add-on
@chapter IPMI iKVM module add-on
@anchor{#ipmi-ikvm-module-add-on}
Don't use it. It uses proprietary firmware and adds a backdoor (remote out-of-band management chip, similar to the @uref{http://libreboot.org/faq/#intelme,Intel Management Engine}. Fortunately, the firmware is unsigned (possibly to replace) and physically separate from the mainboard since it's on the add-on module, which you don't have to install.

@node Flash chips
@chapter Flash chips
@anchor{#flash-chips}
2MiB flash chips are included by default, on these boards. It's on a P-DIP 8 slot (SPI chip). The flash chip can be upgraded to higher sizes: 4MiB, 8MiB or 16MiB. With at least 8MiB, you could feasibly fit a compressed linux+initramfs image (BusyBox+Linux system) into CBFS and boot that, loading it into memory.

Libreboot has configs for 2, 4, 8 and 16 MiB flash chip sizes (default flash chip is 2MiB).

@strong{DO NOT hot-swap the chip with your bare hands. Use a P-DIP 8 chip extractor. These can be found online. See @uref{http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools,http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools}}

@node Native graphics initialization
@chapter Native graphics initialization
@anchor{#native-graphics-initialization}
Only text-mode is known to work, but linux(kernel) can initialize the framebuffer display (if it has KMS - kernel mode setting).

@itemize
@item
LRDIMM memory modules are currently incompatible
@item
SAS (via PIKE 2008 module) requires non-free option ROM (and SeaBIOS) to boot from it (theoretically possible to replace, but you can put a kernel in CBFS or on SATA and use that to boot GNU, which can be on a SAS drive. The linux kernel can use those SAS drives (via PIKE module) without an option ROM).
@item
IPMI iKVM module (optional add-on card) uses proprietary firmware. Since it's for remote out-of-band management, it's theoretically a backdoor similar to the Intel Management Engine. Fortunately, unlike the ME, this firmware is unsigned which means that a free replacement is theoretically possible. For now, the libreboot project recommends not installing the module. @uref{https://github.com/facebook/openbmc,This project} might be interesting to derive from, for those who want to work on a free replacement. In practise, out-of-band management isn't very useful anyway (or at the very least, it's not a major inconvenience to not have it).
@item
Graphics: only text-mode works. See @ref{#graphics,#graphics}
