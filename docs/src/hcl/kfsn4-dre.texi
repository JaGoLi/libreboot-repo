@chapter ASUS KFSN4-DRE server/workstation board
@anchor{#asus-kfsn4-dre-serverworkstation-board}
This is a server board using AMD hardware (Fam10h). It can also be used for building a high-powered workstation. Powered by libreboot.

@strong{NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518. To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it from source using the libreboot git repository.}

Flashing instructions can be found at @uref{../install/index.html#flashrom,../install/index.html#flashrom}

@uref{index.html,Back to previous index}.

@node Form factor
@chapter Form factor
@anchor{#form-factor}
These boards use the SSI EEB 3.61 form factor; make sure that your case supports this. This form factor is similar to E-ATX in that the size is identical, but the position of the screws are different.

@node Flash chips
@chapter Flash chips
@anchor{#flash-chips}
These boards use LPC flash (not SPI), in a PLCC socket. The default flash size 1MiB (8Mbits), and can be upgraded to 2MiB (16Mbits). SST49LF080A is the default that the board uses. SST49LF016C is an example of a 2MiB (16Mbits) chip, which might work. It is believed that 2MiB (16Mbits) is the maximum size available for the flash chip.

@strong{DO NOT hot-swap the chip with your bare hands. Use a PLCC chip extractor. These can be found online. See @uref{http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools,http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools}}

@node Native graphics initialization
@chapter Native graphics initialization
@anchor{#native-graphics-initialization}
Native graphics initialization exists (XGI Z9s) for this board. Framebuffer- and text-mode both work. A serial port is also available.

@node Memory
@chapter Memory
@anchor{#memory}
DDR2 533/667 Registered ECC. 16 slots. Total capacity up to 64GiB.

@node Hex-core CPUs
@chapter Hex-core CPUs
@anchor{#hex-core-cpus}
PCB revision 1.05G is the best version of this board (the revision number will be printed on the board), because it can use dual hex-core CPUs (Opteron 2400/8400 series). Other revisions are believed to only support dual quad-core CPUs.

There seems to be a 30 second bootblock delay (observed by tpearson); the system otherwise boots and works as expected. See @uref{../resources/text/kfsn4-dre/bootlog.txt,kfsn4-dre/bootlog.txt} - this uses the 'simple' bootblock, while tpearson uses the 'normal' bootblock, which tpearson suspects may be a possible cause. This person says that they will look into it. @uref{http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=board-status.git;a=blob;f=asus/kfsn4-dre/4.0-10101-g039edeb/2015-06-27T03:59:16Z/config.txt;h=4742905c185a93fbda8eb14322dd82c70641aef0;hb=055f5df4e000a97453dfad6c91c2d06ea22b8545,This config} doesn't have the issue.

Text-mode is a bit jittery (but still usable). (the jitter disappears if using KMS, once the kernel starts. The jitter will remain, if booting the kernel in text-mode).
