This is a desktop board using intel hardware. It can make for quite a nifty desktop. Powered by libreboot.

@strong{NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518. To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it from source using the libreboot git repository.}

NOTE: video framebuffer currently unsupported, only text-mode works, even when booting GNU/Linux.
This can still be used for building a headlesss server.
