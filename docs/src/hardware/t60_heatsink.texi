rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, and thermal compound for changing CPU heatsink (procedure involves removing heatsink)

thermal compound/paste (Arctic MX-4 is good. Others are also good.)

Remove those screws and remove the HDD:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0001,,,,JPG} @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0002,,,,JPG}

Lift off the palm rest:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0003,,,,JPG}

Lift up the keyboard, pull it back a bit, flip it over like that and then disconnect it from the board:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0004,,,,JPG} @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0005,,,,JPG} @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0006,,,,JPG}

Gently wedge both sides loose:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0007,,,,JPG} @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0008,,,,JPG}

Remove that cable from the position:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0009,,,,JPG} @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0010,,,,JPG}

Remove the bezel (sorry forgot to take pics).

On the CPU (and there is another chip south-east to it, sorry forgot to take pic) clean off the old thermal paste (with the alcohol) and apply new (Artic Silver 5 is good, others are good too) you should also clean the heatsink the same way@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0051,,,,JPG}

This is also an opportunity to change the CPU to another one. For example if you had a Core Duo T2400, you can upgrade it to a better processor (higher speed, 64-bit support). A Core 2 Duo T7600 was installed here.

Attach the heatsink and install the screws (also, make sure to install the AC jack as highlighted):@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0052,,,,JPG}

Reinstall that upper bezel:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0053,,,,JPG}

Do that:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0054,,,,JPG} @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0055,,,,JPG}

Attach keyboard:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0056,,,,JPG}

Place keyboard and (sorry, forgot to take pics) reinstall the palmrest and insert screws on the underside:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0058,,,,JPG}

It lives!@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0071,,,,JPG} @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0072,,,,JPG} @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0073,,,,JPG}

Always stress test ('stress -c 2' and xsensors. below 90C is ok) when replacing cpu paste/heatsink:@* @image{../resources/images/t60_dev/0074,,,,JPG}
