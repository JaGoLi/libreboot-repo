	<h1 id="why">What is libreboot, really?</h1>

		<p>
			Libreboot is a <a href="http://coreboot.org/">coreboot</a> distribution (distro) with proprietary software removed,
			intended to be a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free</a>
			(libre) 'BIOS' replacement for your computer.
		</p>

		<p>
			Read the full <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software definition</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Project goals (and differences versus coreboot):
		</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Coreboot contains blobs (proprietary data/code) and libreboot does not (it intentionally removes them).
				</li>
				<li>
					Coreboot is hacker-friendly and focuses on software developers, libreboot is user-focused and attempts to 
					turn coreboot into a distribution, sort of like a GNU/Linux distribution (same concept, different software). For example, libreboot 
					distributes GRUB/memtest86+/bucts/flashrom (and more) and comes with user-focused documentation and build scripts; libreboot 
					is therefore made more 'user-friendly'.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Libreboot is <b>not</b> a fork of coreboot, despite misconceptions of this fact. Libreboot (downstream supplier) is a parallel effort 
				which works closely with and re-bases on the latest coreboot (upstream supplier) every so often.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>
					As such, all new coreboot development should be done in coreboot, not libreboot!
					Libreboot is about deblobbing, and packaging coreboot in a user-friendly way, where most work is already done for the user!
					If, for example you wanted to attempt porting a new motherboard then you should do that in coreboot. Libreboot will (as a downstream)
					receive your change at some point in the future, in a future release.
				</b>
			</p>

		<h2>
			A 'stable' coreboot:
		</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Coreboot uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling release</a> model 
					(and it is therefore quite volatile; one day when you build coreboot, it may or may not work correctly on your machine).
				</li>
				<li>
					Libreboot changes less often (as far as the release model is concerned), focusing instead on 'tested' releases for <i>specific machines</i>.
					At any given time, it might also be possible to build ROM images for systems other than those officially supported. If you get your board to work
					(without violating the <i>&quot;coreboot development goes in coreboot&quot;</i> rule), then others could benefit from it.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				On the other hand, coreboot is also strict about what it accepts (merges) into the main git repository: 
				most of the time, a lot of changes are under review at review.coreboot.org (as a way of encouraging as much further development
				as possible before accepting the patch).
			</p>

			<p>
				Meanwhile, libreboot is a lot less strict in this area and freely merges specific patches that are desirable, sometimes before they are merged into coreboot's main repository.
