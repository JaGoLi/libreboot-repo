	<h1 id="why">What is libreboot, really?</h1>

		<h2>
			Project goals (and differences versus coreboot):
		</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Coreboot contains blobs (proprietary data/code) and libreboot does not (it intentionally removes them).
				</li>
				<li>
					Coreboot is hacker-friendly and focuses on software developers, libreboot is user-focused and attempts to 
					turn coreboot into a distribution, sort of like a GNU/Linux distribution (same concept, different software). For example, libreboot 
					distributes GRUB/memtest86+/bucts (and more) and comes with user-focused documentation and build scripts; libreboot 
					is therefore made more 'user-friendly'.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Libreboot is <b>not</b> a fork of coreboot, despite misconceptions of this fact. Libreboot (downstream supplier) is a parallel effort 
				which works closely with and re-bases on the latest coreboot (upstream supplier) every so often.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>
					As such, all new coreboot development should be done in coreboot, not libreboot!
					Libreboot is about deblobbing, and packaging coreboot in a user-friendly way, where most work is already done for the user!
					If, for example you wanted to attempt porting a new motherboard then you should do that in coreboot. Libreboot will (as a downstream)
					receive your change at some point in the future, in a future release.
				</b>
			</p>

		<h2>
			A 'stable' coreboot:
		</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Coreboot uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling release</a> model 
					(and it is therefore quite volatile; one day when you build coreboot, it may or may not work correctly on your machine).
				</li>
				<li>
					Libreboot changes less often (as far as the release model is concerned), focusing instead on 'tested' releases for <i>specific machines</i>
					At any given time, it might also be possible to build ROM images for systems other than those officially supported. If you get your board to work
					(without violating the <i>&quot;coreboot development goes in coreboot&quot;</i>, then others could benefit from your work.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				On the other hand, coreboot is also strict about what it accepts (merges) into the main git repository: 
				most of the time, a lot of changes are under review at review.coreboot.org (as a way of encouraging as much further development
				as possible before accepting the patch).
			</p>

			<p>
				Meanwhile, libreboot is a lot less strict in this area and freely merges specific patches that are desirable, sometimes before they are merged into coreboot's main repository.
			</p>

<hr/>

	<h1 id="build_dependencies">Install build dependencies</h1>

		<p>
			Before doing anything, you need the dependencies first. 
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>deps-trisquel</b> script installs dependencies for Trisquel 6 (also tested in Trisquel 7).</li>
				<li><b>deps-parabola</b> script installs dependencies for Parabola</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
			For all other GNU/Linux distributions, you may have to adapt these scripts. By all means send patches!
		</p>

		<p><a href="#pagetop">Back to top of page</a></p>

<hr/>

	<h1 id="build_meta">Get the full source code from metadata (git clone)</h1>

		<p>
			If you downloaded libreboot from git, then there are some steps to download and patch
			the source code for all relevant dependencies. The archive in the git repository used to be
			available as a tarball called 'libreboot_meta.tar.gz'. It contains 'metadata' (scripts) 
			which define how the source was created (where it came from).
		</p>

		<p>
			You can use the scripts included to dwnload everything.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, <a href="#build_dependencies">install the build dependencies</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			After that, run the get script:<br/>
			<b>$ ./getall</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			What this did was download everything (grub, coreboot, memtest86+, bucts, flashrom)
			at the versions last tested for this release, and patch them. Read the script
			in a text editor to learn more.
		</p>

		<p>
			To build the ROM's, see <a href="#build">#build</a>.
		</p>

		<p><a href="#pagetop">Back to top of page.</a></p>

<hr/>

	<h1 id="build_bucts">How to build &quot;bucts&quot; (for LenovoBIOS X60/X60S/X60T/T60)</h1>

		<p>
			<b>This is for Lenovo BIOS users on the ThinkPad X60/X60S, X60 Tablet and T60. If you have coreboot or libreboot running already, ignore this.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Bucts is needed when flashing in software the X60/X60S/X60T/T60 ROM while Lenovo BIOS is running;
			external flashing will be safe regardless.
			Each ROM contains identical data inside the two final 64K region in the file.
			This corresponds to the final two 64K regions in the flash chip. Lenovo BIOS will prevent you from writing the
			final one, so running &quot;<b>bucts 1</b>&quot; will set the machine to boot from the other block instead (which
			is writeable along with everything beneath it when using a patched flashrom. see <a href="#build_flashrom">#build_flashrom</a>). 
			After shutting down and booting up after the first flash,
			the final 64K block is writeable so you flash the ROM again with an unpatched flashrom and run "<b>bucts 0</b>" to
			make the machine boot from the normal (highest) block again.
		</p>

		<p>
			BUC.TS utility is included in libreboot_src.tar.gz and libreboot_bin.tar.gz.<br/>
			<b>If you downloaded from git, follow <a href="#build_meta">#build_meta</a> before you proceed.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;BUC&quot; means &quot;<b>B</b>ack<b>u</b>p <b>C</b>ontrol&quot; (it's a register) and &quot;TS&quot; means &quot;<b>T</b>op <b>S</b>wap&quot;
			(it's a status bit). Hence &quot;bucts&quot; (BUC.TS). TS 1 and TS 0 corresponds to bucts 1 and bucts 0.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, <a href="#build_dependencies">install the build dependencies</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To build bucts, do this in the main directory:<br/>
			<b>$ ./builddeps-bucts</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The &quot;builddeps&quot; script in libreboot_src also makes use of builddeps-bucts.
		</p>

		<p><a href="#pagetop">Back to top of page.</a></p>

<hr/>

	<h1 id="build_flashrom">How to build &quot;flashrom&quot;</h1>

		<p>
			Flashrom is the utility for flashing/dumping ROM's. This is what you will use to install libreboot.
		</p>

		<p>
			Flashrom source code is included in libreboot_src.tar.gz and libreboot_bin.tar.gz.<br/>
			<b>If you downloaded from git, follow <a href="#build_meta">#build_meta</a> before you proceed.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			First, <a href="#build_dependencies">install the build dependencies</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To build it, do that in the main directory:<br/>
			<b>$ ./builddeps-flashrom</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			After you've done that, under ./flashrom/ you will find the following executables:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>flashrom</b>
				<ul>
					<li>For flashing while coreboot or libreboot is running.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>flashrom_lenovobios_sst</b>
				<ul>
					<li>This is patched for flashing while Lenovo BIOS is running on an X60 or T60 with the SST25VF016B (SST) flash chip.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>flashrom_lenovobios_macronix</b>
				<ul>
					<li>This is patched for flashing while Lenovo BIOS is running on an X60 or T60 with the MX25L1605D (Macronix) flash chip.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The &quot;builddeps&quot; script in libreboot_src also makes use of builddeps-flashrom.
		</p>

		<p><a href="#pagetop">Back to top of page.</a></p>

<hr/>

	<h1 id="config">Configuring libreboot</h1>

		<p>
			Before building a ROM in libreboot (or coreboot, for that matter), you need to configure it.
			This is done using the following inside the source tree:<br/>
			<b>$ make menuconfig</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			If you've already built a kernel before, you know how to use this interface.
		</p>

		<p>
			Configurations are then saved as files called <b>&quot;.config&quot;</b>. Copies of each configuration used
			for each machine type by the libreboot build scripts are stored in resources/libreboot/config/
		</p>

		<h2 id="config_dmidecode">
			dmidecode
		</h2>
			<p>
				There is certain information that can be useful to enter in particular:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Local version string</li>
				<li>SMBIOS Serial Number</li>
				<li>SMBIOS Manufacturer</li>
				<li>SMBIOS Version</li>
				<li>SMBIOS Product name</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This information can be obtained using:<br/>
				<b>$ sudo dmidecode</b><br/>
				<b># dmidecode</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Specifically, it's good practise to enter the same information for libreboot that you found when running this
				with the original BIOS or firmware. <b>libreboot has already done this for you. This information is for reference,
				in the hope that it will be useful.</b>

	<h1 id="t60_ati_intel">ThinkPad T60 (ATI GPU) and ThinkPad T60 (Intel GPU) differences.</h1>

		<p>
			If your T60 is a 14.1&quot; or 15.1&quot; model with an ATI GPU, it won't work with libreboot by default but
			you can replace the motherboard with another T60 motherboard that has an Intel GPU, and then libreboot should work.
		</p>

		<p>
			As far as I know, 14.1&quot; (Intel GPU) and 15.1&quot; (Intel GPU) T60 motherboards are the same, where
			'spacers' are used on the 15.1&quot; T60. In any case, it makes sense to find one that is guaranteed to fit in your chassis.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is also a 15.4&quot; T60 with Intel GPU.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note: the T60<b>p</b> laptops all have ATI graphics. 
			The T60p laptops cannot be used with libreboot under any circumstances.
		</p>

		<p>
			The following T60 motherboard (see area highlighted in white) shows an empty space where the ATI GPU would be (this particular motherboard has an Intel GPU):
			<img src="howtos/t60_dev/t60_unbrick.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			The reason that the ATI GPU on T60 is unsupported is due to the VBIOS (Video BIOS) which is non-free. 
			The VBIOS for the Intel GPU on X60/T60 has been reverse engineered, and replaced with Free Software and
			so will work in libreboot.
		</p>

		<p>
			The 'Video BIOS' is what initializes graphics.
		</p>

		<p>
			See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_BIOS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_BIOS</a>.<br/>
			In fact, lack of free VBIOS in general is a big problem in coreboot, and is one reason (among others) why many ports for coreboot are 
			unsuitable for libreboot's purpose.
		</p>

		<p>
			Theoretically, the ThinkPad T60 with ATI GPU can work with libreboot and have ROM's compiled for it, however
			in practise it would not be usable as a laptop because there would be no visual display at all. That being said,
			such a configuration is acceptable for use in a 'headless' server setup (with serial and/or ssh console as the display).

			You need to replace OS X with GNU/Linux before flashing libreboot. (OSX won't run at all in libreboot).
		</p>

		<p>
			There are some issues with this machine (compared to other computers that libreboot supports):
		</p>

		<p>
			This is an apple laptop, so it comes with OS X: it has an Apple keyboard, which means that certain keys you expect are missing:
			insert, del, home, end, pgup, pgdown. There is also one mouse button only. Battery life is poor compared to X60/T60 (for now). 
			It also has other issues: for example, the Apple logo on the back is a hole, exposing the backlight, which means that it glows. You should cover it up.
		</p>

		<p>
			The macbook21 gets extremely hot under GNU/Linux and libreboot; Macfanctld (mac fan control daemon) I'm told is a programme (GPLv3 license) that can help with this.
		</p>

		<p>
			Debugging the heating issues (initial work):<br/>
			Distro: Trisquel 7. kernel(linux-libre): 3.13.0-32<br/>
			<b>CPU temperatures:</b><br/>
			52C(idle)/81C(stress) on factory.bin<br/>
			70C(idle)/80C(stress) on coreboot(with microcode updates). libreboot results (without microcode updates) were the same.<br/>
			(libreboot and coreboot rom's were both built from the same code, just with or without microcode included in the rom)<br/>
			battery life was higher on original firmware, lower on coreboot/libreboot.<br/>
			microcode patches included [y/n] makes no difference.<br/>
			libreboot: 1hr18min left on idle (99% battery), 42mins left on stress (82% battery)<br/>
			factory.bin: 2 hours left on idle (99% battery), 48mins left on stress (82% battery)

		<div class="important">

			<p>
				Hover over the next paragraph to make it black.
			</p>
			<p class="lenovobios">
				Following this guide means simply flashing a libreboot ROM. This guide will not (directly) teach you how to make a backup (dump) of the original Lenovo BIOS
				because to do so would be to explicitly endorse proprietary software. However, for the purposes of reverse engineering it can be useful
				to have a backup. Each copy of the original Lenovo BIOS is tied to the specific machine that it came from; it will not run
				on any other machine, even if it's the same type of machine as yours. What this means is that, effectively, you can back it up now (so that you can
				re-flash it later if you want to run the original Lenovo BIOS again) or lose it forever. The X60/T60 installation
				guide on the coreboot wiki will show you how to do this: 
				<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation">http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation</a>.<br/>
				Do not make this decision lightly! This is your last and only chance.
			</p>

			<p>
				The following is for the libreboot image and *not* the factory bios dump:
			</p>
			<p>
				Check the last two 64K regions in your ROM file (libreboot.rom in this example):<br/>
				<b>$ dd if=libreboot.rom of=top64k.bin bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s libreboot.rom) - 0x10000] count=64k</b><br/>
				<b>$ dd if=libreboot.rom of=lower64k.bin bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s libreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k</b><br/>
				<b>$ sha512sum lower64k.bin top64k.bin</b><br/>
				Make *sure* that they match before you continue. The ROM's included pre-compiled in libreboot should already match.
				If they don't match, then do this (based on those instructions from <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation">coreboot wiki</a>):<br/>
				<b>$ dd if=top64k.bin of=libreboot.rom bs=1 seek=$[$(stat -c %s libreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k conv=notrunc</b><br/>
				After this, the ROM will be safe to flash. Explanation is provided in <a href="#build_bucts">#build_bucts</a>.

	<h1 id="grub_font">Setting font in GRUB (for reference)</h1>

		<p>You don't need to do this unless you would like to change the default font yourself.
		(this is just for reference. It has already been done for you)</p>

		<p>The old font used was Unifont, and this had some missing characters: for instance, the border showed ??? characters instead of lines.</p>

		<p>I tried DeJavu Sans Mono from this website:
		<a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download">dejavu-fonts.org</a></p>

		<p>Specifically, the version that I chose was the latest at the time of writing (Saturday 21 June 2014):
		<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dejavu/files/dejavu/2.34/dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.34.tar.bz2">this one</a></p>

		<p>This is a free font that is also contained in GNU/Linux distributions like Trisquel or Parabola.</p>

		<p><b>$ cd libreboot_src/grub</b><br/>
		compile grub ('build' script has the info on how to do this)<br/>
		come back out into libreboot_src/resources/grub:<br/>
		<b>$ cd ../libreboot_src/resources/grub/font</b></p>

		<p>I took Dejavu Sans Mono from dejavu (included in this version of libreboot) and did:<br/>
		<b>$ ../../../grub/grub-mkfont -o dejavusansmono.pf2 ../../../dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.34/ttf/DejaVuSansMono.ttf</b></p>

		<p>I then added the instructions to 'build' script to include resources/grub/dejavusansmono.pf2 in all of the ROM's in root of cbfs.<br/>
		I then added that instructions to the grub.cfg files (to load the font):<br/>
		<b>loadfont (cbfsdisk)/dejavusansmono.pf2</b></p>

				Go in grub directory:<br/>
				<b>cat frazerty | ./grub/grub-mklayout -o frazerty.gkb</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				You must make sure that the files are named keymap and keymap.gkb (where 'keymap' can be whatever you want).

			<p>
				Then from the above example, you would put <b>frazerty</b> in <b>resources/utilities/grub-assemble/keymap/original/</b> and

	<h1 id="serial">X60/T60: Serial port - how to use (for dock owners)</h1>
		<p>
			For the Thinkpad X60 you can use the <b>&quot;UltraBase X6&quot;</b> dock (for the X60 Tablet it is called
			X6 Tablet UltraBase). For the ThinkPad T60, 
			you can use the <b>&quot;Advanced Mini Dock&quot;</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are using one of the ROM's with 'serial' in the name, then you have serial port enabled in libreboot
			and you have memtest86+ included inside the ROM. Connect your null modem cable to the serial port on the dock
			and connect the other end to a 2nd machine using your USB Serial adapter.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the 2nd machine, you can try this (using GNU Screen):<br/>
			<b>$ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			How to quit GNU Screen: Ctrl+A then release and press K, and then press Y.
		</p>
		<p>There are also others like Minicom but I like GNU Screen</p>
		<p>
			By doing this before booting the X60/T60, you will see console output from libreboot. You will also see
			GRUB displaying on the serial output, and you will be able to see MemTest86+ on the serial output aswell.
			You can also configure your distro so that a terminal (TTY) is accessible from the serial console.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following guide is for Ubuntu, and can be followed for Trisquel 6.0 which is based on Ubuntu 12.04
			(should also work in Trisquel 7, based on Ubuntu 14.04) to enable a serial console using GeTTY:<br/>
			<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SerialConsoleHowto" target="_blank">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SerialConsoleHowto</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Note: part of the tutorial above requires changing your grub.cfg. Just change the <b>linux</b> line to add instructions for enabling getty.
			See <a href="howtos/grub_cbfs.html">howtos/grub_cbfs.html</a>.

	<h1 id="get_edid_panelname">Get EDID: Find out the name (model) of your LCD panel</h1>
		<p>
			Get the panel name with <b>sudo get-edid | strings</b><br/>
			Or look in <b>/sys/class/drm/card0-LVDS-1/edid</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			If neither of these options work (or they are unavailable), physically removing the LCD panel is an option. 
			Usually, there will be information printed on the back.

	Read that thread: http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2014-July/078261.html
	(link published to coreboot mailing list on July 8, 2014)
	Document everything listed in this discussion (and the link)

	SeaVGABIOS+SeaBIOS support for X60/T60 (VBT is missing, see docs/future/index.html):
	Read that: http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2014-July/078342.html

	This page talks about 'calibration' in powertop:
	https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/15/html/Power_Management_Guide/PowerTOP.html
	I should think about adapting information here based on that page.

	Look into 'git archive' instead of deleting .git
	eg (coreboot directory):
	git archive --format=tar --prefix=libreboot/ -o ../libreboot_release.tar HEAD

	Very useful(!!):
