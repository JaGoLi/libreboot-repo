            <p>
                We are asked why we don't endorse most FSF-endorsed distributions,
                usually well-known within the FSF community.
            </p>
            <p>
                To learn more about the GNU/Linux systems that we do endorse,
                check out our list of
                <a href="../distros/">free GNU/Linux distributions</a>. The <em>only</em>
                FSF-endorsed distribution that we endorse there is <em>Parabola</em>.

        <h2>Blag</h2>
            <p>
                It's a dead project.
            </p>
        <h2>Dragora</h2>
            <p>
                It's a dead project.
            </p>
        <h2>Dynebolic</h2>
            <p>
                It's a dead project.
            </p>
        <h2>gNewSense</h2>
            <p>
                It's a dead project.
            </p>
        <h2>GuixSD</h2>
            <p>
                It's the GNU project's official distribution.
                <a href="../../gnu/">Libreboot is opposed to the GNU project</a>.
                It's actively developed, but it's not yet ready for use by
                most end users.
            </p>
        <h2>Musix</h2>
            <p>
                It's a dead project.
            </p>
        <h2>Trisquel</h2>
            <p>
                The lead developer (Ruben Rodriguez) of Trisquel is one of the accused FSF employees
                in their <a href="../../gnu/">recent discriminatory firing of
                a trans person from the FSF</a>, and Trisquel is one of the most
                aggressively promoted distributions on the part of the Free Software
                Foundation. We are opposed to the FSF, and Trisquel endorses them,
                so endorsing Trisquel means endorsing the FSF.
            </p>
        <h2>Ututo</h2>
            <p>
                It's a dead project.
            </p>
