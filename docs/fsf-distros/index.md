Explaining Why We Don't Endorse FSF-endorsed Systems 
=====================================================

We are asked why we don't endorse most FSF-endorsed distributions,
usually well-known within the FSF community.

To learn more about the GNU+Linux systems that we do endorse, check out
our list of [free GNU+Linux distributions](../distros/). The *only*
FSF-endorsed distribution that we endorse there is *Parabola*.

Blag
----

It's a dead project.

Dynebolic
---------

It's a dead project.

gNewSense
---------

It's a dead project.

GuixSD
------

It's the GNU project's official distribution. [Libreboot is opposed to
the GNU project](../../gnu/). It's actively developed, but it's not
yet ready for use by most end users.

Musix
-----

It's a dead project.

Trisquel
--------

The lead developer (Ruben Rodriguez) of Trisquel is one of the accused
FSF employees in their [recent discriminatory firing of a trans person
from the FSF](../../gnu/), and Trisquel is one of the most aggressively
promoted distributions on the part of the Free Software Foundation. We
are opposed to the FSF, and Trisquel endorses them, so endorsing
Trisquel means endorsing the FSF.

The lead developer (Ruben Rodriguez) also works full-time as an FSF
sysadmin, and seems to barely have time to develop Trisquel these days.
As a result, with a lack of leadership (and Ruben presumably still
*holding on*), the project has stalled and will probably end up becoming
a dead distro. *Critical security updates are currently delayed compared
to Ubuntu, their upstream!*

Several people within the Trisquel project have even left the project as
a result of this. For instance, this post on the Trisquel forums clearly
shows such discontent:
<https://trisquel.info/en/forum/im-leaving-trisquel>

We advise all users of Trisquel, whether they use libreboot or not, to
switch to the most similar free distribution, Debian, which is listed on
our [official list of GNU+Linux distributions
recommendations](../distros/).
