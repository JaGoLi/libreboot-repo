</head>

<body><div class="section"><p>If you're using libreboot from git, note that only CrOS devices build at the moment. We merged a newly rewritten build system recently, and we've yet to complete re-integration of older boards into Libreboot.

		<h1>How to install NetBSD on a libreboot system</h1>
            <p>
				This section relates to preparing, booting and installing
				NetBSD on your libreboot system, using nothing more than a USB flash drive (and <i>dd</i>). They've only been tested on a librebooted ThinkPad X60.
			</p>
            <p>
                It is expected that you use text mode in libreboot (txtmode images),
                for the early boot process in NetBSD.
                <strong>Suspend/hibernate is broken, according to at least 1 user.</strong>

            netbsd.iso is the installation image for NetBSD. Adapt
            the filename accordingly, for your version of NetBSD.
        </p>

        <h2>Prepare the USB drive (in NetBSD)</h2>
            <p>
               <a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/tutorials/how_to_install_netbsd_from_an_usb_memory_stick/">This page</a>
               on the NetBSD website shows how to create a NetBSD bootable USB drive
               from within NetBSD itself. You should use the <em>dd</em> method
               documented there.
            </p>

        <h2>Prepare the USB drive (in FreeBSD)</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/bsdinstall-pre.html">This page</a>
                on the FreeBSD website shows how to create a bootable USB drive
                for installing FreeBSD. Use the <em>dd</em> on that page. You can
                also use the same instructions with a NetBSD ISO image.
            </p>

		<h2>Prepare the USB drive (in LibertyBSD or NetBSD)</h2>

            <p>
                If you downloaded your ISO on a LibertyBSD or NetBSD system,
                here is how to create the bootable NetBSD USB drive:
            </p>

			<p>
				Connect the USB drive. Check dmesg:<br/>
				<b>$ dmesg | tail</b><br/>

				Check to confirm which drive it is, for example, if you think its sd3:<br/>
				<b>$ disklabel sd3</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Check that it wasn't automatically mounted. If it was, unmount it. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ doas umount /dev/sd3i</b><br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				dmesg told you what device it is. Overwrite the drive, writing the NetBSD installer to it with dd. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ doas netbsd.iso of=/dev/rsdXc bs=1M; sync</b><br/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You should now be able to boot the installer from your USB drive. Continue reading, for
				information about how to do that.

		<h2>Prepare the USB drive (in GNU+Linux)</h2>

            <p>
                If you downloaded your ISO on a GNU+Linux system,
                here is  how to create the bootable NetBSD USB drive:
            </p>

			<p>
				Connect the USB drive. Check dmesg:<br/>
				<b>$ dmesg</b><br/>

				Check lsblk to confirm which drive it is:<br/>
				<b>$ lsblk</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Check that it wasn't automatically mounted. If it was, unmount it. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ sudo umount /dev/sdX*</b><br/>
				<b># umount /dev/sdX*</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				dmesg told you what device it is. Overwrite the drive, writing your distro ISO to it with dd. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ sudo dd if=install60.fs of=/dev/sdX bs=8M; sync</b><br/>
				<b># dd if=netbsd.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M; sync</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You should now be able to boot the installer from your USB drive. Continue reading, for
				information about how to do that.

		<h2>Installing NetBSD without full disk encryption</h2>

			    You might have to use an external USB keyboard during the installation.
                Press C to access the GRUB terminal.
            </p>
			<p>
				grub&gt; <b>knetbsd -r sd0a (usb0,netbsd1)/netbsd</b><br/>

		<h2>Configuring Grub</h2>

			<p>
				If you don't want to drop to the GRUB command line and type in a command to boot NetBSD every time, you can create a GRUB configuration that's aware of your NetBSD installation and that will automatically be used by libreboot.
      </p>
			<p>
			On your NetBSD root partition, create the <b>/grub</b> directory and add the file <b>libreboot_grub.cfg</b> to it. Inside the <b>libreboot_grub.cfg</b> add these lines:
			<p><b>
			default=0
			timeout=3
			menuentry "NetBSD" {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knetbsd -r wd0a (ahci0,netbsd1)/netbsd<br>
			}<br>
			</b></p>
			<p>The next time you boot, you'll see the old Grub menu for a few seconds, then you'll see the a new menu with only NetBSD on the list. After 3 seconds NetBSD will boot, or you can hit enter to boot.

	<div id="troubleshooting" class="section">
		
		<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

			<p>
				Most of these issues occur when using libreboot with coreboot's 'text mode' instead of the coreboot framebuffer.
				This mode is useful for booting payloads like memtest86+ which expect text-mode, but for NetBSD
				it can be problematic when they are trying to switch to a framebuffer because it doesn't exist.
			</p>

			<p>
				In most cases, you should use the vesafb ROM images. Example filename: libreboot_ukdvorak_vesafb.rom.
			</p>

			<h2>won't boot...something about file not found</h2>
				<p>
					Your device names (i.e. usb0, usb1, sd0, sd1, wd0, ahci0, hd0, etc) and numbers may differ. Use TAB completion.
