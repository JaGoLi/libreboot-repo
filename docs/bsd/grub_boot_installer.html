		<h1>How to install OpenBSD on a libreboot system</h1>
			<p>
				This section relates to preparing, booting and installing a
				OpenBSD distribution on your libreboot system, using nothing more than a USB flash drive (and <i>dd</i>). They've only been tested on a Lenovo ThinkPad x200.

		<h2>Prepare the USB drive (in OpenBSD)</h2>

			<p>
				Connect the USB drive. Check dmesg:<br/>
				<b>$ dmesg | tail</b><br/>

				Check to confirm which drive it is, for example, if you think its sd3:<br/>
				<b>$ disklabel sd3</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Check that it wasn't automatically mounted. If it was, unmount it. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ doas umount /dev/sdXz</b><br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				dmesg told you what device it is. Overwrite the drive, writing your distro ISO to it with dd. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ doas dd if=install60.iso of=/dev/rsdXz bs=1M; sync</b><br/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You should now be able to boot the installer from your USB drive. Continue reading, for
				information about how to do that.

		<h2>Installing OpenBSD without full disk encryption</h2>

			<p>
				Press C in GRUB to access the command line:
			</p>
			<p>
				grub> <b>kopenbsd (usb0)/6.0/amd64/bsd.rd</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				It will start booting into the OpenBSD installer. Follow the normal process for installing OpenBSD.

		<h2>Installing OpenBSD with full disk encryption</h2>

			<p>
				Not working. You can modify the above procedure (installation w/o encryption) to install OpenBSD using full disk encryption, and it appears to work, except that its not yet clear how to actually <i>boot</i> an OpenBSD+FDE installation using libreboot+Grub2. If you get it working, please let us know.

		<h2>Booting</h2>

			<p>
				Press C in GRUB to access the command line:
			</p>
			<p>
				grub> <b>kopenbsd -r sd0a (ahci0,openbsd1)/bsd</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				OpenBSD will start booting. Yay!

	<div id="configuring_grub" class="section">
		
		<h2>Configuring Grub</h2>

			<p>
			If you don't want to drop to the GRUB command line and type in a command to boot OpenBSD every time, you can create a GRUB configuration that's aware of your OpenBSD installation and that will automatically be used by libreboot. The <a href="../gnulinux/grub_cbfs.html">instructions</a> are the same as for GNU/Linux.
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, create a Grub2 config file that will add OpenBSD to the GRUB menu and set it as the default. Place your config at /grub/libreboot_grub.cfg. Reboot. Viola.
			</p>

	<div id="troubleshooting" class="section">
		
		<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

			<p>
				Most of these issues occur when using libreboot with coreboot's 'text mode' instead of the coreboot framebuffer.
				This mode is useful for booting payloads like memtest86+ which expect text-mode, but for OpenBSD distributions
				it can be problematic when they are trying to switch to a framebuffer because it doesn't exist.
			</p>

			<p>
				In most cases, you should use the vesafb ROM images. Example filename: libreboot_ukdvorak_vesafb.rom.
			</p>

			<h2>won't boot...something about file not found</h2>
				<p>
					You device names (i.e. usb0, usb1, sd0, sd1, wd0, ahci0, hd0, etc) and numbers may differ. Use TAB completion.
