		<h2>Prepare the USB drive (in GNU+Linux)</h2>

            <p>
                If you downloaded your ISO on an existing GNU+Linux system,
                here is  how to create the bootable GNU+Linux USB drive:
            </p>

			<p>
				Connect the USB drive. Check dmesg:<br/>
				<b>$ dmesg</b><br/>

				Check lsblk to confirm which drive it is:<br/>
				<b>$ lsblk</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Check that it wasn't automatically mounted. If it was, unmount it. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ sudo umount /dev/sdX*</b><br/>
				<b># umount /dev/sdX*</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				dmesg told you what device it is. Overwrite the drive, writing your distro ISO to it with dd. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ sudo dd if=gnulinux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M; sync</b><br/>
				<b># dd if=gnulinux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M; sync</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You should now be able to boot the installer from your USB drive. Continue reading, for
				information about how to do that.

        <h2>Prepare the USB drive (in NetBSD)</h2>
            <p>
               <a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/tutorials/how_to_install_netbsd_from_an_usb_memory_stick/">This page</a>
               on the NetBSD website shows how to create a NetBSD bootable USB drive
               from within NetBSD itself. You should use the <em>dd</em> method
               documented there. This will also work with any GNU+Linux ISO image.
            </p>

        <h2>Prepare the USB drive (in FreeBSD)</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/bsdinstall-pre.html">This page</a>
                on the FreeBSD website shows how to create a bootable USB drive
                for installing FreeBSD. Use the <em>dd</em> on that page. You can
                also use the same instructions with any GNU+Linux ISO image..
            </p>

		<h2>Prepare the USB drive (in LibertyBSD or OpenBSD)</h2>

            <p>
                If you downloaded your ISO on a LibertyBSD or OpenBSD system,
                here is how to create the bootable GNU+Linux USB drive:
            </p>

			<p>
				Connect the USB drive. Check dmesg:<br/>
				<b>$ dmesg | tail</b><br/>

				Check to confirm which drive it is, for example, if you think its sd3:<br/>
				<b>$ disklabel sd3</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Check that it wasn't automatically mounted. If it was, unmount it. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ doas umount /dev/sd3i</b><br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				dmesg told you what device it is. Overwrite the drive, writing the OpenBSD installer to it with dd. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ doas dd if=gnulinux.iso of=/dev/rsdXc bs=1M; sync</b><br/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You should now be able to boot the installer from your USB drive. Continue reading, for
				information about how to do that.

		<h2>Debian or Devuan net install?</h2>

			<p>
                Download the Debian or Devuan net installer. You can download the ISO from the homepage on
                <a href="https://www.debian.org/">debian.org</a>, or <a href="https://www.devuan.org/">the Devuan homepage</a> for Devuan.
                Use this on the GRUB terminal to boot it from USB (for 64-bit Intel or AMD):<br/>
                <strong>
                set root='usb0'<br/>
                linux /install.amd/vmlinuz<br/>
                initrd /install.amd/initrd.gz<br/>
                boot<br/>
                </strong>
                If you are on a 32-bit system (e.g. X60):<br/>
                <strong>
                set root='usb0'<br/>
                linux /install.386/vmlinuz<br/>
                initrd /install.386/initrd.gz<br/>
                boot

	<div id="parse_isolinux" class="section">
		
		<h2>Booting ISOLINUX images (automatic method)</h2>

			<p>
				Boot it in GRUB using the <i>Parse ISOLINUX config (USB)</i> option.

				A new menu should appear in GRUB, showing the boot options for that distro; this is a GRUB menu, converted from the usual
				ISOLINUX menu provided by that distro.

	<div id="manual_isolinux" class="section">
		
		<h2>Booting ISOLINUX images (manual method)</h2>

			<p>
				<i>These are generic instructions. They may or may not be correct for your
				distribution. You must adapt them appropriately, for whatever GNU+Linux distribution
				it is that you are trying to install.</i>
			</p>

			<p>
				If the ISOLINUX parser or <i>Search for GRUB configuration</i> options won't work, then press C in GRUB to access the command line.<br/>
					grub&gt; <b>ls</b><br/>

				Get the device from above output, eg (usb0). Example:<br/>
					grub&gt; <b>cat (usb0)/isolinux/isolinux.cfg</b><br/>

				Either this will show the ISOLINUX menuentries for that ISO, or link to other .cfg files, for example /isolinux/foo.cfg.<br/>

				If it did that, then you do:<br/>
					grub&gt; <b>cat (usb0)/isolinux/foo.cfg</b><br/>

				And so on, until you find the correct menuentries for ISOLINUX.
				<b>The file <i>/isolinux/foo.cfg</i> is a fictional example. Do not actually
				use this example, unless you actually have that file, if it is appropriate.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				For Debian or Devuan (and other debian-based distros), there are typically menuentries listed in
				<i>/isolinux/txt.cfg</i> or <i>/isolinux/gtk.cfg</i>. For dual-architecture ISO images
				(i686 and x86_64), there may be separate files/directories for each architecture.
				Just keep searching through the image, until you find the correct ISOLINUX configuration file.
                NOTE: Debian 8.6 ISO only lists 32-bit boot options in txt.cfg. This is important if you want
                64-bit booting on your system. Devuan versions based on Debian 8.x may also have the same
                issue.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now look at the ISOLINUX menuentry. It'll look like:<br/>
				<b>
					kernel /path/to/kernel<br/>
					append PARAMETERS initrd=/path/to/initrd MAYBE_MORE_PARAMETERS<br/>
				</b>

				GRUB works the same way, but in it's own way. Example GRUB commands:<br/>
					grub&gt; <b>set root='usb0'</b><br/>
					grub&gt; <b>linux /path/to/kernel PARAMETERS MAYBE_MORE_PARAMETERS</b><br/>
					grub&gt; <b>initrd /path/to/initrd</b><br/>
					grub&gt; <b>boot</b><br/>
				Note: <i>usb0</i> may be incorrect. Check the output of the <i>ls</i> command in GRUB,
				to see a list of USB devices/partitions.

				Of course this will vary from distro to distro. If you did all of that correctly, then it should now be booting your USB
				drive in the way that you specified.

		<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

			<p>
				Most of these issues occur when using libreboot with coreboot's 'text mode' instead of the coreboot framebuffer.
				This mode is useful for booting payloads like memtest86+ which expect text-mode, but for GNU+Linux distributions
				it can be problematic when they are trying to switch to a framebuffer because it doesn't exist.
			</p>

			<p>
				In most cases, you should use the vesafb ROM images. Example filename: libreboot_ukdvorak_vesafb.rom.
			</p>

			<h2>parabola won't boot in text-mode</h2>

				<p>
					Use one of the ROM images with vesafb in the filename (uses coreboot framebuffer instead of text-mode).
				</p>

			<h2>debian-installer graphical corruption in text-mode (Debian and Devuan)</h2>
				<p>
					When using the ROM images that use coreboot's &quot;text mode&quot; instead of the coreboot framebuffer,
					booting the Debian or Devuan net installer results in graphical corruption because it is trying to switch to a framebuffer which doesn't
					exist. Use that kernel parameter on the 'linux' line when booting it:<br/>
					<b>vga=normal fb=false</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					This forces debian-installer to start in text-mode, instead of trying to switch to a framebuffer.
				</p>

				<p>
					If selecting text-mode from a GRUB menu created using the ISOLINUX parser, you can press E on the menu entry to add this.
					Or, if you are booting manually (from GRUB terminal) then just add the parameters.
				</p>

				<p>
					This workaround was found on the page: <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch05s04.html">https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch05s04.html</a>.
					It should also work for Debian, Devuan and any other apt-get distro that provides debian-installer (text mode) net install method.
