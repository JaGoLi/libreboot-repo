		<h1 id="pagetop">How to change your default GRUB menu</h1>
			<p>
				Libreboot uses the GRUB <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Payloads#GRUB_2">payload</a> 
				by default, which means that the GRUB configuration file 
				(where your GRUB menu comes from) is stored directly alongside libreboot
				and it's GRUB payload executable, inside
				the flash chip. In context, this means that installing distributions and managing them 
				is handled slightly differently compared to traditional BIOS systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				A libreboot (or coreboot) ROM image is not simply &quot;flat&quot;; there is an actual 
				filesystem inside called CBFS (coreboot filesystem). A utility called 'cbfstool' 
				allows you to change the contents of the ROM image. In this case, libreboot is configured 
				such that the 'grub.cfg' and 'grubtest.cfg' files exists directly inside CBFS instead of 
				inside the GRUB payload 'memdisk' (which is itself stored in CBFS).
			</p>
			<p>
				You can either modify
				the GRUB configuration stored in the flash chip, or you can modify a GRUB configuration
				file on the main storage which the libreboot GRUB payload will automatically search for.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is an excellent writeup about CBFS (coreboot filesystem):

		<h2 id="libreboot_grub_config_ondisk">Don't want to flash a new ROM image?</h2>

			<p>
				There are several advantages to modifying the GRUB configuration stored in CBFS, but
				this also means that you have to flash a new libreboot ROM image on your machine (some users
				feel intimidated by this, to say the least).
				Doing so can be risky if not handled correctly, because it can result in a bricked
				machine (recovery is easy if you have the <a href="../install/bbb_setup.html">equipment</a>
				for it, but most people don't). If you aren't up to that then don't worry; it is possible
				to use a custom GRUB menu without flashing a new image, by loading a GRUB configuration
				from a partition on the main storage instead.
			</p>

			<p>
				By default, GRUB in libreboot is configured to scan all partitions on the main storage
				for /boot/grub/libreboot_grub.cfg or /grub/libreboot_grub.cfg(for systems where /boot
				is on a dedicated partition), and then use it automatically.
			</p>
			<p>
				Simply create your custom GRUB configuration and save it to <b>/boot/grub/libreboot_grub.cfg</b>
				on the running system. The next time you boot, GRUB (in libreboot) will automatically switch to
				this configuration file. <b>This means that you do not have to re-flash, recompile or otherwise
				modify libreboot at all!</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Ideally, your distribution should automatically generate a libreboot_grub.cfg file that is written
				specifically under the assumption that it will be read and used on a libreboot system that uses
				GRUB as a payload. If your distribution does not do this, then you can try to add that feature
				yourself or politely ask someone involved with or otherwise knowledgeable about the distribution
				to do it for you. The libreboot_grub.cfg could either contain the full configuration, or it could
				chainload another GRUB ELF executable (built to be used as a coreboot payload) that is located in
				a partition on the main storage.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you want to adapt a copy of the existing <i>libreboot</i> GRUB configuration and use that for the libreboot_grub.cfg file, then
				follow <a href="#build_cbfstool">#build_cbfstool</a>, <a href="#which_rom">#which_rom</a> and
				<a href="#extract_grubtest">#extract_grubtest</a> to get the <b><i>grubtest.cfg</i></b>. 
				Rename <b><i>grubtest.cfg</i></b> to <b><i>libreboot_grub.cfg</i></b> and save it to <b><i>/boot/grub/</i></b>
				on the running system where it is intended to be used. Modify the file at that location however you see fit, 
				and then stop reading this guide (the rest of this page is irrelevant to you); <b>in libreboot_grub.cfg on disk,
				if you are adapting it based on grub.cfg from CBFS then remove the check for libreboot_grub.cfg otherwise it will loop.</b>.

		<h2 id="build_cbfstool">Build 'cbfstool' from source</h2>

			<p>
				If you are working with libreboot_src, then you can run <b><i>make</i></b> command in 
				libreboot_src/coreboot/util/cbfstool to build the <b><i>cbfstool</i></b> and <b><i>rmodtool</i></b>
				executable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively if you are working with libreboot_bin, you will find binaries under ./cbfstool/

		<h2 id="which_rom">Which ROM image should I use?</h2>

			<p>
				You can work directly with one of the ROM images already included in the libreboot ROM archives. For the purpose of 
				this tutorial it is assumed that your ROM image file is named <i>libreboot.rom</i>, so please make sure to adapt.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you want to re-use the ROM that you currently have flashed (and running) then see 
				<a href="../git/index.html#build_flashrom">../git/index.html#build_flashrom</a>
				and then run:<br/>
				<b>$ sudo ./flashrom -p internal -r libreboot.rom</b><br/>
				Notice that this is using <b>&quot;-r&quot;</b> (read) instead of <b>&quot;-w&quot;</b> (write). 
				This will create a dump (copy) of your current firmware and name it <b>libreboot.rom</b>. 
				You need to take ownership of the file. For example:<br/>
				<b>$ sudo chown yourusername:yourusername libreboot.rom</b><br/>
				<b># chown yourusername:yourusername libreboot.rom</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				If you currently have flashed a ROM image from an older version, it is recommended to update first: 
				basically, modify one of the latest ROM images and then flash it.

		<h2 id="extract_grubtest">Extract grubtest.cfg from the ROM image</h2>

			<p>
				Display contents of ROM:<br/>
				<b>$ ./cbfstool libreboot.rom print</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				The libreboot.rom file contains your <i>grub.cfg</i> and <i>grubtest.cfg</i> files. 
				You should extract, modify and re-insert the copy first. grub.cfg will load first, 
				but it has a menu entry for switching to the copy (grubtest.cfg).
				This reduces your chance of making a mistake that could make your machine unbootable (or very hard to boot).
			</p>

			<p>
				Extract grubtest.cfg from the ROM image:<br/>
				<b>$ ./cbfstool libreboot.rom extract -n grubtest.cfg -f grubtest.cfg</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now you have a grubtest.cfg in cbfstool directory. Edit it however you wish.

			<h2 id="example_modifications">Example modifications for <i>grubtest.cfg</i></h2>

				<p>
					These are some common examples of ways in which the grubtest.cfg file can be modified.
				</p>

				<h3 id="example_modifications_trisquel">Trisquel GNU/Linux-libre</h3>

					<p>
						As an example, on my test system in /boot/grub/grub.cfg (on the HDD/SSD) I see for the main menu entry:
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li><b>linux	/boot/vmlinuz-3.15.1-gnu.nonpae root=UUID=3a008e14-4871-497b-95e5-fb180f277951 ro   crashkernel=384M-2G:64M,2G-:128M quiet splash $vt_handoff</b></li>
							<li><b>initrd	/boot/initrd.img-3.15.1-gnu.nonpae</b></li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						<b>ro</b>, <b>quiet</b>, <b>splash</b>, <b>crashkernel=384M-2G:64M,2G-:128M</b> and 
						<b>$vt_handoff</b> can be safely ignored.
					</p>

					<p>
						I use this to get my partition layout:<br/>
						$ <b>lsblk</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						In my case, I have no /boot partition, instead /boot is on the same partition as / on sda1. 
						Yours might be different. In GRUB terms, sda means ahci0. 1 means msdos1, or gpt1, depending 
						on whether I am using MBR or GPT partitioning. Thus, /dev/sda1 is GRUB is (ahci0,msdos1) or 
						(ahci0,gpt1). In my case, I use MBR partitioning so it's (ahci0,msdos1).
						'msdos' is a GRUB name simply because this partitioning type is traditionally used by MS-DOS. 
						It doesn't mean that you have a proprietary OS.
					</p>

					<p>
						Trisquel doesn't keep the filenames of kernels consistent, instead it keeps old kernels and 
						new kernel updates are provided with the version in the filename. This can make GRUB payload 
						a bit tricky. Fortunately, there are symlinks /vmlinuz and /initrd.img
						so if your /boot and / are on the same partition, you can set GRUB to boot from that. 
						These are also updated automatically when installing kernel updates from your distributions 
						apt-get repositories.
						<b>
							Note: when using <a href="http://jxself.org/linux-libre">jxself kernel releases</a>, 
							these are not updated at all and you have to update them manually.
						</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						For the GRUB payload grubtest.cfg (in the 'Load Operating System' menu entry), we therefore have (in this example):<br/>
						<b>set root='ahci0,msdos1'</b><br/>
						<b>linux /vmlinuz root=UUID=3a008e14-4871-497b-95e5-fb180f277951</b><br/>
						<b>initrd /initrd.img</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						Optionally, you can convert the UUID to its real device name, for example /dev/sda1 in this case.
						sdX naming isn't very reliable, though, which is why UUID is used for most distributions.
					</p>

					<p>
						Alternatively, if your /boot is on a separate partition then you cannot rely on the /vmlinuz and /initrd.img symlinks.
						Instead, go into /boot and create your own symlinks (update them manually when you install a new kernel update).<br/>
						$ <b>sudo -s</b><br/>
						# <b>cd /boot/</b><br/>
						# <b>rm -rf vmlinuz initrd.img</b><br/>
						# <b>ln -s <u>kernel</u> ksym</b><br/>
						# <b>ln -s <u>initrd</u> isym</b><br/>
						# <b>exit</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						Replace the underlined <b>kernel</b> and <b>initrd</b> filenames above with the actual filenames, of course.
					</p>

					<p>
						Then your grubtest.cfg menu entry (for payload) becomes like that, for example if / was on sda2 and /boot was on sda1:<br/>
						<b>set root='ahci0,msdos1'</b><br/>
						<b>linux /ksym root=/dev/sda2</b><br/>
						<b>initrd /isym</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						There are lots of possible variations so please try to adapt.
					</p>

				<h3 id="example_modifications_parabola">Parabola GNU/Linux-libre</h3>

					<p>
						You can basically adapt the above. Note however that Parabola does not keep old kernels still installed, and the file names 
						are always consistent, so you don't need to boot from symlinks, you can just use the real thing directly.
					</p>

			<p>
				A user reported that segmentation faults occur with cbfstool 
				when using this procedure depending on the size of the grub.cfg being re-insterted. 
				In his case, a minimum size of 857 bytes was required. This could (at the time of 
				this release) be a bug in cbfstool that should be investigated with the coreboot 
				community. If cbfstool segfaults, then keep this in mind. 'strace' (or gdb? clang?) 
				could be used for debugging. This was in libreboot 5th release (based on coreboot 
				from late 2013), and I'm not sure if the issue persists in the current releases.
				I have not been able to reproduce it. strace (from that user) is here: 
				<a href="cbfstool_libreboot5_strace">cbfstool_libreboot5_strace</a>. 
				The issue has been reported by a few users, so it does not happen all the time: 
				this bug (if it still exists) could (should) be reproduced.
