    </p>

    <p>
      This board is a mini-itx desktop board for 2008. It uses an atom 
230, which is a singe core CPU but it is hyperthreaded so it appears to 
have 2 thread to the OS. The flash chip is very small, 512KiB, so grub2 
does not fit, which is why libreboot has to use seabios on this target. 
Full disk encryption like on other supported targets will not be 
possible, so plan accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This board has a 945gc chipset which is the desktop equivalent of 
945gm which can be found in the Lenovo x60/t60 or macbook2,1. This 
chipset features an ICH7 southbridge. It has 1 DIMM slot that can 
accommodate up to 2G of DDR2 RAM.       
    </p>
    <p>
      Connectivity-wise it has 1 PCI slot,  a 10/100 ethernet port, 4 
usb slot and 4 usb ports, with one internal header and 2 SATA ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      The D945GCLF2 is an upgraded version of this board. The 
differences are: 1 more USB header, 10/100/1000 ethernet and a dual core
 cpu (also hyperthreaded). Since the board is almost identical (and 
coreboot code seem to indicate that it works, since MAX_CPU=4 is set), 
it is believed that it should also work but this is untested.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Remarks about vendor bios:
    </h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Without coreboot/libreboot this board is utery useless, since the 
vendor bios is very bad. It cannot boot from any HDD wether it is 
connected to the SATA port or USB. With libreboot it works just fine.</li>
	<li>The vendor bios write protects the flash so it requires external 
flashing to install libreboot on this device. Once libreboot is flashed 
there is no problem to update the firmware internally</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>How to replace thermal paste and fan</h2>
    <p>
   This board comes with very crappy disposable loud fan, that one has no bearings,
which can not be repaired or oiled properly, do not waste your time trying to fix it, just buy one chinese same size fan<br/>
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_141620.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_141614.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
   <br/>
   Make sure that new one has same wiring<br/>
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_142618.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br/>
   This is a new one, with bearing and maintenable<br/>
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_141738.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_141814.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br/>
   Now remove the both coolers rotating them a bit, slowly, then clean both silicons
and both coolers (removing cmos battery first is recommended)<br/>
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_141601.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br/>
   Put a little bit of non conductive thermal paste on both silicons (only cpu silicon iis shown on that image)<br/>
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_142031.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br/>
   <p>Before assembling new fan, some need new longer screws, make sure having these (on the left is original one, too short for new fan)<br/>
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_141659.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br/>
   After that, assemble your new fan into CPU cooler<br/>
   <img alt="" src="../images/d945gclf/20160923_141635.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br/>
   Finally assemle both coolers on both chips, do not forget put in the CPU fan connector back, and you are done.
