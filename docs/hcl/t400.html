				It is believed that all or most T400 laptops are compatible. 
				See notes about <a href="../install/t400_external.html#cpu_compatibility">CPU compatibility</a>
				for potential incompatibilities.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the T400: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
				This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
				is SOIC-16.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>The T400 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
				by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="gm45_remove_me.html">gm45_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
				instructions)

            <p>
                It is recommended that you update to the latest EC firmware version.
                The <a href="https://libreboot.org/faq/#firmware-ec">EC firmware</a>
                is separate from libreboot, so we don't actually provide that, but
                if you still have Lenovo BIOS then you can just run the Lenovo BIOS
                update utility, which will update both the BIOS and EC version.
                See:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://libreboot.org/docs/install/index.html#flashrom">https://libreboot.org/docs/install/index.html#flashrom</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_update_without_optical_disk">http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_update_without_optical_disk</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                NOTE: this can only be done when you are using Lenovo BIOS. How to
                update the EC firmware while running libreboot is unknown. 
                Libreboot only replaces the BIOS firmware, not EC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Updated EC firmware has several advantages e.g.
                bettery battery handling.

				<h3 id="hwvirt">Hardware virtualization (vt-x)</h3>
					<p>
						The T400, when run without CPU microcode updates in coreboot, currently kernel panics
						if running QEMU with vt-x enabled on 2 cores for the guest. With a single core enabled
						for the guest, the guest panics (but the host is fine). Working around this in QEMU
						might be possible; if not, software virtualization should work fine (it's just slower).
					</p>
					<p>
						On GM45 hardware (with libreboot), make sure that the <i>kvm</i> and <i>kvm_intel</i> kernel modules
						are not loaded, when using QEMU.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following errata datasheet from Intel might help with investigation:

			The T400 is almost identical to the X200, code-wise. See <a href="x200.html">x200.html</a>.

			The coreboot wiki <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Motherboard_Porting_Guide">shows</a>
			how to collect various logs useful in porting to new
			boards.  Following are outputs from the T400:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				T400 with <b>Winbond W25X64</b> flash chip (8MiB, SOIC-16)
				and Lenovo BIOS 2.02 (EC firmware 1.01):
				<ul>
					<li><a href="../future/dumps/logs-t400-bios2.02-ec1.01/">../future/dumps/logs-t400-bios2.02-ec1.01/</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Version of flashrom used for the external flashing/reading logs is the one that libreboot git revision c164960 uses.
