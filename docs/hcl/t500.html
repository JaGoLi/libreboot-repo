				It is believed that all or most T500 laptops are compatible. 
				See notes about <a href="../install/t500_external.html#cpu_compatibility">CPU compatibility</a>
				and <a href="../install/t500_external.html#switchable_graphics">switchable graphics</a> for
				potential incompatibilities.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the R400: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
				This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
				is SOIC-16.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>The T500 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
				by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="gm45_remove_me.html">gm45_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
				instructions)
			</p>

				Flashing instructions can be found at <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">../install/index.html#flashrom</a>

			The T500 is almost identical to the X200, code-wise. See <a href="x200.html">x200.html</a>.

				See
				<a href="../future/dumps/t500_x200_descriptor/descriptor_diff_t500_x200.txt">../future/dumps/t500_x200_descriptor/descriptor_diff_t500_x200.txt</a>
				and
				<a href="../future/dumps/t500_x200_descriptor/gbe_diff_t500_x200.txt">../future/dumps/t500_x200_descriptor/gbe_diff_t500_x200.txt</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The patches above are based on the output from ich9deblob on a factory.rom image dumped from the T500
				with a SOIC-8 4MiB flash chip. The patch re-creates the X200 descriptor/gbe source, so the commands were
				something like:<br/>
				$ <b>diff -u t500gbe x200gbe</b><br/>
				$ <b>diff -u t500descriptor x200descriptor</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				ME VSCC table is in a different place and a different size on the T500. Libreboot disables and removes the ME
				anyway, so it doesn't matter.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The very same descriptor/gbe used on the X200 (generated by <a href="gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen">ich9gen</a>)
				was re-used on the T500, and it still worked.

			The coreboot wiki <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Motherboard_Porting_Guide">shows</a>
			how to collect various logs useful in porting to new
			boards.  Following are outputs from the T500:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				T500 with <b>TODO: PUT FLASH CHIP HERE</b> flash chip (4MiB, SOIC-8)
				and <b>TODO: PUT BIOS/EC VERSION HERE</b>:
				<ul>
					<li>TODO: put logs here</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Version of flashrom used for the external flashing/reading logs is the one that libreboot git revision c164960 uses.
			</li>
		</ul>
