ASUS KCMA-D8 desktop/workstation board 
======================================

This is a desktop board using AMD hardware (Fam10h **and Fam15h** CPUs
available). It can also be used for building a high-powered workstation.
Powered by libreboot. The coreboot port was done by Timothy Pearson of
Raptor Engineering Inc. and, working with them, merged into libreboot.

**Memory initialization is still problematic, for some modules. We
recommend avoiding Kingston modules.**

Flashing instructions can be found at
[../install/\#flashrom](../install/#flashrom) - note that external
flashing is required (e.g. BBB), if the proprietary (ASUS) firmware is
currently installed. If you already have libreboot, by default it is
possible to re-flash using software running in GNU+Linux on the kcma-d8,
without using external hardware.

CPU compatibility
=================

**Use Opteron 4200 series (works without microcode updates, including hw
virt).** 4300 series needs microcode updates, so avoid those CPUs. 4100
series is too old, and mostly untested.



Board status (compatibility) {#boardstatus}
============================

See <https://raptorengineeringinc.com/coreboot/kcma-d8-status.php>.



Form factor {#formfactor}
===========

These boards use the SSI EEB 3.61 form factor; make sure that your case
supports this. This form factor is similar to E-ATX in that the size is
identical, but the position of the screws are different.



IPMI iKVM module add-on {#ipmi}
=======================

Don't use it. It uses proprietary firmware and adds a backdoor (remote
out-of-band management chip, similar to the [Intel Management
Engine](http://libreboot.org/faq/#intelme). Fortunately, the firmware is
unsigned (possibly to replace) and physically separate from the
mainboard since it's on the add-on module, which you don't have to
install.



Flash chips {#flashchips}
===========

2MiB flash chips are included by default, on these boards. It's on a
P-DIP 8 slot (SPI chip). The flash chip can be upgraded to higher sizes:
4MiB, 8MiB or 16MiB. With at least 8MiB, you could feasibly fit a
compressed linux+initramfs image (BusyBox+Linux system) into CBFS and
boot that, loading it into memory.

Libreboot has configs for 2, 4, 8 and 16 MiB flash chip sizes (default
flash chip is 2MiB).

**DO NOT hot-swap the chip with your bare hands. Use a P-DIP 8 chip
extractor. These can be found online. See
<http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools>**



Native graphics initialization {#graphics}
==============================

Only text-mode is known to work, but linux(kernel) can initialize the
framebuffer display (if it has KMS - kernel mode setting).



Current issues {#issues}
==============

-   LRDIMM memory modules are currently incompatible
-   SAS (via PIKE 2008 module) requires non-free option ROM (and
    SeaBIOS) to boot from it (theoretically possible to replace, but you
    can put a kernel in CBFS or on SATA and use that to boot GNU, which
    can be on a SAS drive. The linux kernel can use those SAS drives
    (via PIKE module) without an option ROM).
-   IPMI iKVM module (optional add-on card) uses proprietary firmware.
    Since it's for remote out-of-band management, it's theoretically a
    backdoor similar to the Intel Management Engine. Fortunately, unlike
    the ME, this firmware is unsigned which means that a free
    replacement is theoretically possible. For now, the libreboot
    project recommends not installing the module. [This
    project](https://github.com/facebook/openbmc) might be interesting
    to derive from, for those who want to work on a free replacement. In
    practise, out-of-band management isn't very useful anyway (or at
    the very least, it's not a major inconvenience to not have it).
-   Graphics: only text-mode works. See [\#graphics](#graphics)
