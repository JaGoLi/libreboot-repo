			This sections relates to known hardware compatibility in libreboot.
		</p>
		<p>
			Or <a href="index.html">back to main index</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			It is believed that all X200 laptops are compatible. X200s and X200t may also work,
			but require soldering (for the initial installation/flashing of a ROM image, or
			dumping the current firmware). <b>Only the X200 is tested so far.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			It *might* be possible to put an X200 motherboard in an X201 chassis, though this is currently untested
			by the libreboot project. The same may also apply between X200s and X201s; again, this is untested.
			<b>It's most likely true.</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are two possible flash chip sizes for the X200: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
			This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
			is SOIC-16.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>The X200 laptops come with ME (and sometimes AMT) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
			by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="x200_remove_me.html">x200_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
			instructions)
		</p>

			Flashing instructions can be found at <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom_x200">../install/index.html#flashrom_x200</a>

			<h3>X200</h3>
				<p>
					Adapted from <a href="https://github.com/bibanon/Coreboot-ThinkPads/wiki/ThinkPad-X200">https://github.com/bibanon/Coreboot-ThinkPads/wiki/ThinkPad-X200</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Look at wikipedia for difference between TN and IPS panels. IPS have much better colour/contrast than
					a regular TN, and will typically have good viewing angles.
				</p>
				<p>
					These seem to be from the X200 tablet. You need to find one without the glass touchscreen protection on it
					(might be able to remove it, though). It also must not have a digitizer on it (again, might be possible to 
					just simply remove the digitizer).
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>BOE-Hydis HV121WX4-120, HV121WX4-110 or HV121WX4-100 - cheap-ish, might be hard to find</li>
						<li>Samsung LTN121AP02-001 - common to find, cheap</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					<b>If your X200 has an LED backlit panel in it, then you also need to get an inverter and harness cable 
					that is compatible with the CCFL panels. To see which panel type you have, see 
					<a href="#led_howtotell">#led_howtotell</a>. If you need the inverter/cable, here are part numbers:
					44C9909 for CCFL LVDS cable with bluetooth and camera connections, and 42W8009 or 42W8010 for the
					inverter.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					There are glossy and matte versions of these. Matte means anti-glare, which is what you want (in this authors opinion).
				</p>
				<p>
					Refer to the HMM (hardware maintenance manual) for how to replace the screen.
				</p>

			<h3>X200s</h3>

					explains that the X200s screens/assemblies are thinner. You need to replace the whole lid with one from a normal X200/X201.

	<h1 id="led_howtotell">How to tell if it has an LED or CCFL?</h1>
	
		<p>
			Some X200's have a CCFL backlight and some have an LED backlight, in their LCD panel. This 
			also means that the inverters will vary, so you must be careful if ever replacing either
			the panel and/or inverter. (a CCFL inverter is high-voltage and will destroy an LED backlit panel).
		</p>
		<p>
			CCFL's contain mercury. An X200 with a CCFL backlight will (<b></b>unless it has been changed to an LED,
			with the correct inverter. Check with your supplier!</b>) the following: <i>&quot;This product
			contains Lithium Ion Battery, Lithium Battery and a lamp which contains mercury; dispose according to
			local, state or federal laws&quot;</i> (one with an LED backlit panel will say something different).
