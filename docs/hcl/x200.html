			It is believed that all X200 laptops are compatible. X200S and X200 Tablet will
			also work, <a href="#x200s">depending on the configuration</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It *might* be possible to put an X200 motherboard in an X201 chassis, though this is currently untested
			by the libreboot project. The same may also apply between X200S and X201S; again, this is untested.
			<b>It's most likely true.</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are two possible flash chip sizes for the X200: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
			This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
			is SOIC-16.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>The X200 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
			by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="x200_remove_me.html">x200_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
			instructions)

			<p>
				Usual limitations apply for native graphics initialization
				(no VBT and/or INT10H and only GRUB works so no BIOS, so no DOS/Windows support
				- who cares? There is no system but GNU, and Linux is one of it's kernels).
			</p>

			<p>
				When connecting the AC adapter while system is powered off, system will then power on.
				This probably happens in coreboot aswell (with or without blobs).
				It's a minor annoyance, but it should be fixed (if it's not already fixed by now).
			</p>

			<p>
				This method of disabling the ME leaves the flash descriptor and gbe in place (non-functional data, fully documented)
				and disables the ME using soft straps. This means that the gigabit ethernet will still work (putting the machine in
				non-descriptor mode would wipe it out, not to mention require hardware modifications that most users will be unwilling to make).
			</p>

			<h3 id="hwvirt">Hardware virtualization (vt-x)</h3>
				<p>
					The X200, when run without CPU microcode updates in coreboot, currently kernel panics
					if running QEMU with vt-x enabled on 2 cores for the guest. With a single core enabled
					for the guest, the guest panics (but the host is fine). Working around this in QEMU
					might be possible; if not, software virtualization should work fine (it's just slower).
				</p>
				<p>
					The following errata datasheet from Intel might help with investigation:
					<a href="http://download.intel.com/design/mobile/specupdt/320121.pdf">http://download.intel.com/design/mobile/specupdt/320121.pdf</a>

		<h2 id="x200s">X200S and X200 Tablet.</h2>

			<p>
				X200S and X200 Tablet have raminit issues at the time of writing
				(GS45 chipset. X200 uses GM45).
			</p>

			<p>
				X200S is known to work, but only with certain CPU+RAM configurations.
				The current stumbling block is RCOMP and SFF, mentioned in
				<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/doc/minimal_boot.pdf">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/doc/minimal_boot.pdf</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The X200 Tablet should also work, but it is not guaranteed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The issues mostly relate to raminit (memory initialization). With an
				unpatched coreboot, you get the following: <a href="text/x200s/cblog00.txt">text/x200s/cblog00.txt</a>.
				No SODIMM combination that was tested would work. At first glance, it looks
				like GS45 (chipset that X200S uses. X200 uses GM45) is unsupported, but
				there is a workaround that can be used to make certain models of the X200S
				work, depending on the RAM.
			</p>
			<p>
				The datasheet for GS45 describes two modes: low-performance and
				high-performance. Low performance uses the SU range of ultra-low
				voltage procesors (SU9400, for example), and high-performance uses the
				SL range of processors (SL9400, for example). According to datasheets,
				GS45 behaves very similarly to GM45 when operating in high-performance
				mode.
			</p>
			<p>
				The theory then was that you could simply remove
				the checks in coreboot and make it pass GS45 off as GM45; the idea is
				that, with a high-performance mode CPU (SL9400, for example) it would
				just boot up and work.
			</p>
			<p>
				This suspicion was confirmed with the following log:
				<a href="text/x200s/cblog01.txt">text/x200s/cblog01.txt</a>.
				The memory modules in this case are 2x4GB. <s><b>However, not all
				configurations work: <a href="text/x200s/cblog02.txt">text/x200s/cblog02.txt</a> (2x2GB)
				and <a href="text/x200s/cblog03.txt">text/x200s/cblog03.txt</a> (1x2GB)
				show a failed bootup.</b></s> <i>False alarm. The modules were mixed (non-matching). X200S 
				with high-performance mode CPU will work so long as you use matching memory modules
				(doesn't matter what size).</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				This was then pushed as a patch for coreboot, which can be found at
				<a href="http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/7786/">http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/7786/</a>
				(libreboot merges this patch in coreboot-libre now. Check the 'getcb' script in
				src or git).
			</p>

			<h3 id="x200s_raminit">Proper GS45 raminit</h3>
				<p>
					A new northbridge gs45 should be added to coreboot, based on gm45,
					and a new port x200st (X200S and X200T) should be added based on
					the x200 port.
				</p>
				<p>
					This port would have proper raminit. Alternatively, gs45 (if
					raminit is taken to be the only issue with it) can be part of
					gm45 northbridge support (and X200S/Tablet being part of the X200
					port) with conditional checks in the raminit that make raminit
					work differently (as required) for GS45. nico_h and pgeorgi/patrickg
					in the coreboot IRC channel should know more about raminit on gm45
					and likely gs45.
				</p>
				<p>
					pgeorgi recommends to run SerialICE on the factory BIOS (for X200S),
					comparing it with X200 (factory BIOS) and X200 (gm45 raminit code
					in coreboot), to see what the differences are. Then tweak raminit
					code based on that.

					Look at wikipedia for difference between TN and IPS panels. IPS have much better colour/contrast than
					a regular TN, and will typically have good viewing angles.
				</p>
				<p>
					These seem to be from the X200 tablet. You need to find one without the glass touchscreen protection on it
					(might be able to remove it, though). It also must not have a digitizer on it (again, might be possible to 
					just simply remove the digitizer).

				<p>
					<b>If your X200 has an LED backlit panel in it, then you also need to get an inverter and harness cable 
					that is compatible with the CCFL panels. To see which panel type you have, see

	<h1 id="led_howtotell">How to tell if it has an LED or CCFL?</h1>
	
		<p>
			Some X200's have a CCFL backlight and some have an LED backlight, in their LCD panel. This 
			also means that the inverters will vary, so you must be careful if ever replacing either
			the panel and/or inverter. (a CCFL inverter is high-voltage and will destroy an LED backlit panel).
		</p>
		<p>
			CCFL's contain mercury. An X200 with a CCFL backlight will (<b></b>unless it has been changed to an LED,
			with the correct inverter. Check with your supplier!</b>) the following: <i>&quot;This product
			contains Lithium Ion Battery, Lithium Battery and a lamp which contains mercury; dispose according to
			local, state or federal laws&quot;</i> (one with an LED backlit panel will say something different).

				ThinkPad R400/R500/T400/T400S/T500/W500. These all use either the GM45 or GS45
				chipset, and should be easy-ish to port to coreboot (based on the X200 port and
				the GM45 code), then adapted for use in libreboot.
			</p>

			<p>
				There may be issues (most likely to do with raminit) on some of them, and
				some of them might sometimse come with ATI graphics (to be avoided) instead
				of Intel.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the R400 currently has issues with raminit (not yet ported to coreboot)
				where it's DDR3 memory reported as DDR2, as shown in
				<a href="text/r400/r400_dmidecode.txt">text/r400/r400_dmidecode.txt</a>

&lt;sgsit&gt; do you know if it's possible to flash thinkpads over the LPC debug connector at the front edge?
&lt;sgsit&gt; that would make life much easier for machines like this
&lt;sgsit&gt; all the Wistron manufactured machines have this thing called a "golden finger", normally at the front edge of the board
&lt;sgsit&gt; you can plug a board in which gives diagnostic codes but i'm wondering whether it is capable of more
