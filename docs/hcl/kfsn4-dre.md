% ASUS KFSN4-DRE server/workstation board 

This is a server board using AMD hardware (Fam10h). It can also be used
for building a high-powered workstation. Powered by libreboot.

Flashing instructions can be found at
[../install/\#flashrom](../install/#flashrom)

[Back to previous index](./).



Form factor {#formfactor}
===========

These boards use the SSI EEB 3.61 form factor; make sure that your case
supports this. This form factor is similar to E-ATX in that the size is
identical, but the position of the screws are different.



Flash chips {#flashchips}
===========

These boards use LPC flash (not SPI), in a PLCC socket. The default
flash size 1MiB (8Mbits), and can be upgraded to 2MiB (16Mbits).
SST49LF080A is the default that the board uses. SST49LF016C is an
example of a 2MiB (16Mbits) chip, which might work. It is believed that
2MiB (16Mbits) is the maximum size available for the flash chip.

**DO NOT hot-swap the chip with your bare hands. Use a PLCC chip
extractor. These can be found online. See
<http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools>**



Native graphics initialization {#graphics}
==============================

Native graphics initialization exists (XGI Z9s) for this board.
Framebuffer- and text-mode both work. A serial port is also available.



Memory
======

DDR2 533/667 Registered ECC. 16 slots. Total capacity up to 64GiB.



Hex-core CPUs {#hexcore}
=============

PCB revision 1.05G is the best version of this board (the revision
number will be printed on the board), because it can use dual hex-core
CPUs (Opteron 2400/8400 series). Other revisions are believed to only
support dual quad-core CPUs.



Current issues {#issues}
==============

-   There seems to be a 30 second bootblock delay (observed by
    tpearson); the system otherwise boots and works as expected. See
    [text/kfsn4-dre/bootlog.txt](text/kfsn4-dre/bootlog.txt) - this uses
    the 'simple' bootblock, while tpearson uses the 'normal'
    bootblock, which tpearson suspects may be a possible cause. This
    person says that they will look into it. [This
    config](http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=board-status.git;a=blob;f=asus/kfsn4-dre/4.0-10101-g039edeb/2015-06-27T03:59:16Z/config.txt;h=4742905c185a93fbda8eb14322dd82c70641aef0;hb=055f5df4e000a97453dfad6c91c2d06ea22b8545)
    doesn't have the issue.
-   Text-mode is a bit jittery (but still usable). (the jitter
    disappears if using KMS, once the kernel starts. The jitter will
    remain, if booting the kernel in text-mode).
