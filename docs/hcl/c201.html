			<p>
				This is a chromebook, using the Rockchip RK3288 chipset. It uses
				an ARM CPU, and has free EC firmware (unlike some other laptops).
				More RK3288-based laptops will be added to libreboot at a later date.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>
					NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518.
					To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it
					from source using the libreboot git repository.
				</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				More info will be added later.
			</p>

			<p>
				Flashing instructions can be found at <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">../install/index.html#flashrom</a>

			<p>
				It's next to the flash chip. Unscrew it, and the flash chip is read-write. Screw it back in, and the flash chip is read-only.
				It's called the screw.
			</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h1 id="ec">EC firmware</h1>
			<p>
				It's free software. Google provides the source. Build scripts will be added later, with EC sources
				provided in libreboot, and builds of the EC firmware.
			</p>

				Non-free drivers needed in linux kernel for video acceleration;
				it's possible to use it without video acceleration.
			</p>
			<p>
				Non-free drivers needed for built-in (soldered) wifi; it's possible
				to use an external USB wifi dongle. Check <a href="index.html#recommended_wifi">index.html#recommended_wifi</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Comes preinstalled (from the factory) with Google ChromeOS. This is a GNU/Linux distribution, but it's not general purpose
				and it comes with proprietary software. It's designed for <i>SaaSS</i>. Libreboot recommends that all users of this laptop
				replace ChromeOS with Debian or Fedora. No FSF-endorsed distribution is available yet, but Guix and Trisquel might be easy
				enough to port.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you go with Debian, make sure to <b><i>not</i></b> enable the <i>non-free</i> and <i>contrib</i> repositories.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you go with Fedora, make sure to <i>delete</i> Linux and replace it with Linux-libre.
