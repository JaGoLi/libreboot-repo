# Install build dependencies
# For trisquel. This might also work on other apt-get distributions.

# Duplications are intentional. Please do not re-factor.
#
# This is so that individual scripts can be installed for specific applications.
# This is, alternatively, so that I can more easily move each part to a separate script.
#

# Really. Most distros come with this anyway
# Parabola does not! If you are using parabola, use "pacman -S wget"
# ------------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get -y install wget

# For downloading source code
# ------------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get -y install subversion git

# For building source code:
# ------------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get -y install build-essential

# Memtest86+ build dependencies
# ------------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get -y install build-essential

# Coreboot build dependencies (also requires build-essential and git)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get -y install libncurses5-dev doxygen iasl gdb flex bison build-essential git

# GRUB build dependencies (also requires build-essential, bison and flex)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get -y install ttf-unifont libopts25 libselinux1-dev autogen m4 autoconf help2man libopts25-dev libfont-freetype-perl automake autotools-dev build-essential bison flex libfuse-dev liblzma-dev gawk libdevmapper-dev libtool libfreetype6-dev

#
# The following have had their dependency lists moved to external scripts:
#
# This is so that users in libreboot_bin can more easily install the dependencies 
# for these, without having to install all of the dependencies for the entire source code
#

# BucTS build dependencies (external script)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

sudo ./builddeb-bucts

# Flashrom build dependencies (also requires build-essential and subversion)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

sudo ./builddeb-flashrom

# ------------------- DONE ----------------------
