# This grabs current base used, and applies patches
# This is also used to run deblob scripts.

# (the idea is that this script will reproduce the coreboot directory included with this version of libreboot)

# You need the dependencies from ./builddeb or ./buildpac to use this script.

# Remove the old version that may exist

echo "DOWNLOADING AND PATCHING COREBOOT"

rm -rf coreboot

# Get latest coreboot:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# download it using git
git clone http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot

# there are modifications required
cd coreboot

# reset to previously tested revision
git reset --hard 23aad4a83c3390dc39f7d1c1f5422f7ac54a80f3

# Get patches from review.coreboot.org
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Text mode patch for X60 native graphics (main patch already merged in coreboot. See 6723 on coreboot gerrit)
git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/25/6725/3 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

# lenovo/x60: Enable legacy brightness controls (native graphics)
git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/48/7048/4 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

## Enable T60 native graphics
# git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/45/5345/8 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
# ^ the above is not needed, because 7050 (see below) uses it
# lenovo/t60: Enable text mode native gfx init:
git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/50/7050/1 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

# Apply necessary patches (from resources/libreboot/patch/)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# no diffs needed at the moment

# Run coreboot-libre deblob scripts
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Deblobbing was done manually for this pre-release (will re-tool linux-libre deblob scripts later):
cd ../
echo "deblobbing coreboot"
./DEBLOB
# The git history (git diff command) shows what blobs were deleted (including the blobs themselves) which is a freedom issue. Just delete .git altogether:
cd coreboot
rm -rf .git
rm -rf .gitreview
rm -rf .gitmodules
rm -rf .gitignore
cd ../
echo "finished deblobbing coreboot"

# we're done
echo "FINISHED DOWNLOADING AND PATCHING COREBOOT"

# ------------------- DONE ----------------------
