# This grabs current base used, and applies patches
# This is also used to run deblob scripts.

# (the idea is that this script will reproduce the coreboot directory included with this version of libreboot)

# You need the dependencies from ./builddeb or ./buildpac to use this script.

# Remove the old version that may exist

echo "DOWNLOADING AND PATCHING COREBOOT"

# Get latest coreboot:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# download it using git
git clone http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot

# there are modifications required
cd coreboot

# reset to previously tested revision
git reset --hard 9310df8d0351842e7bb9efe3cabc0ff82ec99c53

# Get patches from review.coreboot.org
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Text mode patch for X60 native graphics (main patch already merged in coreboot. See 6723 on coreboot gerrit)
git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/25/6725/3 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

## lenovo/x60: Enable legacy brightness controls (native graphics)
## NOT NEEDED. SEE ACPI BRIGHTNESS PATCH BELOW
# git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/48/7048/4 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

# Enable T60 native graphics
git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/45/5345/9 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
# Enable text-mode graphics for T60
git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/50/7050/2 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
## lenovo/t60: Enable legacy brightness controls (native graphics)
## NOT NEEDED. SEE ACPI BRIGHTNESS PATCH BELOW
# git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/51/7051/1 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

# ACPI brightness for i945 targets (x60/t60/x60t/x60s/macbook21):
git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/31/6731/7 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
# Fix uneven backlight levels:
git fetch http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot refs/changes/49/7049/1 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
## note that the 2 changes above are abandoned. Libreboot might have to revert to legacy brightness later on (see above)
## 6731 and and 7049 are still used for now, since they work in GNU/Linux. The author of 6731 abandoned it
## because of incompatibility with Windows, but obviously libreboot doesn't care about that.

# Apply necessary patches (from resources/libreboot/patch/)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# T60: fix compilation when using 6731 from review.coreboot.org
git apply ../resources/libreboot/patch/t60_6731buildfix.diff
## 6731 is abandoned and there's no point putting this in coreboot gerrit.
## there is no harm in it being a diff

# Run coreboot-libre deblob scripts
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Deblobbing was done manually for this pre-release (will re-tool linux-libre deblob scripts later):
cd ../
echo "deblobbing coreboot"
./DEBLOB
# The git history (git diff command) shows what blobs were deleted (including the blobs themselves) which is a freedom issue. Just delete .git altogether:
cd coreboot
rm -rf .git
rm -rf .gitreview
rm -rf .gitmodules
rm -rf .gitignore
cd ../
echo "finished deblobbing coreboot"

# we're done
echo "FINISHED DOWNLOADING AND PATCHING COREBOOT"

# ------------------- DONE ----------------------
